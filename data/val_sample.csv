1,"25 September 2019: The world is “significantly off track” to achieve SDG 1 (no poverty), the latest Overseas Development Institute (ODI) assessment finds, estimating that 430 million people will still live in extreme poverty by 2030. According to ODI, most countries can afford the investment to end extreme poverty if they maximize taxation and allocate 50% of public spending to human development. However, 46 countries will face a £222 billion funding shortfall.The report reiterates the findings of the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 SDG Progress Report, noting that, of the world’s people: 1 in 12 are living in extreme poverty; one in nine are hungry; 50% lack essential healthcare; 50% are not covered by social protection; and one in five children does not attend school.The authors predict that economic growth will cut poverty rates by one-third by 2030, with poverty remaining concentrated in fragile states (86% of the total) and in low-incomes countries (LICs). While half of the extreme poor will still be in middle-income countries (MICs), the publication mentions that they will account for “a relatively small share of the population”: 3% in MICs compared to 25% in LICs.More investment in effective education, health and nutrition, and social protection programmes could end extreme poverty.The publication focuses on public finance (tax and aid), explaining that private finance is rarely used as a major source for the provision of basic social services. The briefing note updates the cost estimates of eradicating poverty for all 138 LICs and MICs, including all 47 least developed countries (LDCs), as well as the cost estimates for a set of social protection programmes designed at the scale needed to lift everyone out of extreme poverty in each country.The assessment recommends that LDCs to increase their tax revenues by a quarter (to the maximum level that is economically feasible) and to allocate half of their public spending to health, education and social protection.In order to close the financing gap and meet SDG 1 by 2030, the publication underscores that Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors need to:Double their collective aid, with all donors meeting the 0.7% official development assistance (ODA) target;Double the share of their collective aid given to the LDCs from one-quarter to a half; andPress all multilateral agencies with a global reach to provide at least half of their support to the poorest countries.Generally, more investment in effective education, health and nutrition, and social protection programmes could end extreme poverty.The report waslaunchedon the sidelines of the UNGA’s high-level week, on 25 September 2019, in New York, US.

4,"27 June 2019: A report launched by the World Bank Group ahead of the G20 Summit finds that people in developing countries spend half a trillion dollars annually (over USD 80 per person) out of their own pockets to access health services, with these expenses most affecting the poor, and proposes solutions. The publication informed a first-ever G20 Finance and Health Ministers joint session hosted by Japan as G20 President, on 28 June 2019 in Osaka.Financing universal health coverage (UHC) in developing countries has been underscored as a priority for Japan’s G20 Presidency, and was discussed also by the G20 Finance Ministers during their meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, from 8-9 June 2019. In theircommunique, the finance ministers highlighted that moving towards UHC contributes to human capital development, sustainable and inclusive growth and development, and prevention, detection and response to health emergencies such as pandemics and anti-microbial resistance. They recognized that a multi-sectoral approach, in particular the collaboration between finance and health authorities, with the “appropriate” contribution of the private sector and NGOs, is “crucial” for strengthening health financing, building on work by international organizations.By 2030 the 54 poorest countries will have a USD 176 billion gap for financing quality, affordable health services for their populations.The World Bank publication titled, ‘High-Performance Health Financing for UHC,’ finds that the majority of developing countries will fail to achieve their targets for UHC and the health- and poverty-related SDGs unless they take urgent steps to strengthen their health financing. It estimates that by 2030, the SDGs’ deadline, there will be a USD 176 billion gap in the 54 poorest countries between the financing needed to provide their populations with quality, affordable health services and funding that is actually available.To address that, the authors call for: increased national investments in health, and making investment in health a whole-of-government priority; improving financial sustainability by scaling proven investments like primary health services that reach the poorest; and taxing tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks to raise revenue and improve health. It also underlines the need for new avenues for international collaboration to support country UHC financing efforts in two main areas: health-financing research and development; and a “sizeable” increase paired with a strategic shift in development assistance for health toward strengthening health-financing leadership, governance and organizational capacity, improved domestic resource use and mobilization, and increased global health security.The report further finds that, even in the best-case scenario with greater, more efficient and more equitable country and international investments, the 2030 UHC financing gap will not be closed, and it urges that health financing be a priority for innovation over the next decade to help bridge the gap.Speaking on the report launch, Mohamed Maait, Minister of Finance of Egypt and African Union (AU) Chair, said that in February 2019 the AU committed to increase national investments in health in the region, and to institutionalize collaboration between Ministers of Finance and Health in Africa.

Additional threats to Europe’s tree species include agriculture and climate change.IUCN Red List Unit Head, Craig Hilton-Taylor said the European Red List assessment highlights the importance of both conserving these species and integrating them into “regular conservation planning and land management.” [IUCN Press Release] [Publication:European Red List of Trees]",224

It will take place as part of every high-level week of the UN General Assembly from 2020 to 2030.Speaking on 6 August 2020, Mohammed reminded delegates that the Moment is meant to serve as an “annual SDG check-in” and snapshot of progress, rather than a comprehensive picture of implementation. It will build on the most recent HLPF session, highlight shortfalls in implementation and investment, and showcase interventions underway to increase action.On the format, she said approximately 20 Heads of State and Government will be able to speak each year, with a three-minute slot. This ensures that all Member States can address the SDG Moment at least once in the coming 11 years.Mohammed said the proposed criteria for participation each year would require States to: be represented at the level of Head of State or Government; have completed at least one Voluntary National Review (VNR); and commit to discussing their implementation gaps as well as plans for filling those gaps. The line-up for each year also needs to ensure regional representation, gender balance, and representation of countries’ different circumstances.In 2020, the SDG Moment will take place for three hours on the morning of Friday, 18 September.

23,"The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has reported on the impacts of four years of work with businesses to set emissions reductions targets. The report findings amount to “a clear signal that the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway,” SBTi argues, as private sector action can lead governments to set more ambitious policies and regulations.SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Since its launch in 2015, over 680 companies have made a commitment to set science-based targets. Each participating company develops targets in a 24-month process and submits them to SBTi, which assesses them against scientific criteria.The report titled, ‘Raising the Bar: Exploring the Science Based Targets initiative’s progress in driving ambitious climate action,’ was published on 4 December 2019. It finds that:A total of 285 companies have set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with scientific guidance on averting dangerous climate change and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Of those 285 companies, 76 have set even more ambitious goals, aligning with limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.Meeting the targets of these 285 companies would mean an emissions reduction of 265 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which SBTi says is approximately equivalent to closing 68 coal-fired power plants.The 285 companies’ targets also will “drive investment of up to USD18 billion in climate change mitigation and spur up to 90 TWh of annual renewable electricity generation.”In some sectors, SBTi reports that over 20% of the high-impact companies have set science-based targets for emissions, showing that it is becoming standard business practice. These sectors include: apparel, biotechnology, food and beverage, healthcare, hospitality, information technology, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications. The report also notes that science-based targets have been approved for companies in high-emitting industries, such as cement, steel, chemicals and automobiles.According to Alexander Farsan, WWF, the participating companies “are proof that acting on climate science goes hand-in-hand with a successful business and economy” He added that companies that do not reduce their emissions according to scientific guidance “risk being left behind.”Among other highlights, the SBTi reports that Japan’s Ministry of Environment set a goal of having 100 Japanese companies with approved targets by 2020. By the end of October 2019, 52 Japanese companies had already done so. The report also finds that in emerging market countries, only a few companies have set science-based targets, with the exception of India, which has nine companies with approved targets.As of 30 January 2020, the ‘Companies Taking Action’ tracking tool on the SBTi website shows that 732 companies are taking science-based climate action, and 312 companies have approved science-based targets.

It includes a food loss and waste quantification method, a food loss and waste hotspot analysis method, and an analysis method for financial losses. It builds on existing methodologies in assessments globally and recent studies.The quantification method shows the quantity of loss at various nodes of the supply chain. For example, the difference between the quantity harvested (in kilograms) and the quantity transported to the wholesale. The hotspot analysis method reflects the throughput efficiency at various stages of the supply chain. For instance, the ratio of transported harvest to the actual harvest. The financial analysis takes into consideration the financial value of lost or wasted food as well as the cost of its transportation as applicable at various nodes. The methodology includes also a food loss and waste record sheet for daily use at every stage of the chain.The formulas are applicable at the production, post-harvest, wholesale, transportation and packing stages of the fresh- produce supply chain.

The representative of Japan, in his capacity as Vice-Chair of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, said the final text did not include an important reference to institution-building. He said this is a means of building and sustaining peace, as is financing, because trust in government is a precondition for tackling the root causes of conflicts. He added that institution building was a primary purpose of the PBC when it was created in 2005.Looking ahead, the resolution calls for a report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation of the resolutions in 2022 and a more detailed report in 2024, and for the next comprehensive review of UN peacebuilding to take place in 2025.

The representative of Japan, in his capacity as Vice-Chair of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, said the final text did not include an important reference to institution-building. He said this is a means of building and sustaining peace, as is financing, because trust in government is a precondition for tackling the root causes of conflicts. He added that institution building was a primary purpose of the PBC when it was created in 2005.Looking ahead, the resolution calls for a report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation of the resolutions in 2022 and a more detailed report in 2024, and for the next comprehensive review of UN peacebuilding to take place in 2025.

They presented the report card during the IOC’s 30th General Assembly session.According to UNESCO, sustained ocean observation is critical for sustainable development and for monitoring progress towards the SDGs. The IOC is responsible for measuring SDG indicator 14.3.1 on ocean acidification. Coordinated monitoring of changes in ocean chemistry is essential for countries to report on SDG target 14.3 (“Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels”). In addition, climate scientists have identified ocean acidification as a “Global Climate Indicator,” one of a set of climate parameters that provides key information on climate change.On ocean acidification, the report card states that anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have “substantially increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations” over the last two centuries. This increase is causing changes in seawater chemistry and resulting in ocean acidification.In the report card, JCCOM calls on governments and other stakeholders to increase contributions to the ocean observing system to meet the need for ocean information and address a wide range of sustainability issues. JCCOM further calls for,inter alia, enhancing collaboration, openly sharing data and optimizing efforts and resources in support of global ocean observation.

43,"August 2019: The UNFCCC Adaptation Committee has a published an online report on approaches to long-term adaptation planning that addresses topics related to various approaches to enhance long-term adaptation planning and action and shares information with Parties as they engage in the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) processes.The UNFCCC Secretariat produced the report ahead of the 16th meeting of the Adaptation Committee, which will convene from 9-12 September 2019 in Bonn, Germany. The paper is intended as a contribution to the Committee’s work on offering technical support and guidance on adaptation action to Parties.The report recognizes the increased attention being paid to long-term adaptation planning as beneficial to enhanced adaptation action. It also emphasizes the need for integrating adaptation with the SDGs and with long-term national development plans to ensure an adequate adaptation response.The report describes the critical role that the NAP process plays in long-term adaptation planning, particularly as countries update their NAPs, by helping Parties to identify medium- and long-term adaptation needs, and to develop and implement strategies and programmes to address those needs. It contends that integrating NAPs into national development planning processes and strategies will help reduce vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change.The paper summarizes information on long-term adaptation planning that could be useful for Parties as they engage in the the process of formulating and implementing NAPs. While no “one-size-fits all” approach exists for long-term adaptation planning, according to the report, such planning can benefit from lessons learned from short-term projects by using capacity built and knowledge collected and generated.The report describes various approaches countries have used for long-term planning, many of which complement each other, including ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA), community-based adaptation (CBA), livelihood diversification and risk-based approaches. According to the paper, adaptation planners and implementers often use elements of several approaches to maximize advantages for a particular situation. A long-term adaptation approach, the publication notes, can help integrate adaptation into development planning processes and strategies, in a manner coherent between NAPs and the SDGs, within relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate.The report also addresses incremental versus transformational change, an iterative approach to long-term planning, and the importance of effective institutional arrangements and stakeholder engagement.

The report underscores the role of trade, fiscal, and monetary policies in achieving the SDGs and supporting sustainable development. For example, the report highlights discussions with the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment on domestic initiatives on waste and chemicals management and recycling and on how trade policy can support the circular economy. In addition, the Aid for Trade initiative contributes to SDG target 8a (increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs)), and gender-responsive trade policies contribute to increasing women’s participation in global trade (in line with SDG 5) while contributing to economic growth (in line with SDG 8).The report provides a review of the WTO’s efforts on SDG 14.6 on prohibiting fisheries subsides that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and on SDG 17.10 on promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system. The report states that discussions on reducing harmful fisheries subsidies are playing a critical role in advancing developing countries’ sustainable development objectives.The report recommends that governments mainstream trade into their national development plans, including by defining a clear national trade policy, ensuring effective institutional coordination, and integrating trade into sector strategies. To support progress on SDG 17.11 (doubling LDCs’ share in global trade by 2020), the report emphasizes the need for measures that address challenges faced by LDCs in international trade to ensure a more equitable distribution of trade benefits.The report also considers the potential impact of COVID-19 on global trade, and shares steps taken by WTO members to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The report reflects that the COVID-19 crisis has had a “major impact” on global supply and demand, resulting in disruptions of global supply chains for goods and services, and concludes that expectations of recovery in the value of world trade “will need to be revised downwards.” The report welcomes the introduction of fiscal and monetary measures by governments to prevent social lockdowns from creating large-scale business failure and job losses.

52,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a policy brief and accompanying technical brief on eliminating lead paint and ways for countries to take action.The briefs, titled ‘Global elimination of lead paint: why and how countries should take action,’ describe lead’s toxic effects on human health, especially for children and pregnant women. The policy brief explains that as paint ages, it begins to crumble and flake, releasing lead into household dust. In addition, lead paint removal by abrasive methods or by charring or burning releases lead dust, particles, and fumes. Children ingest lead-contaminated dust through hand-to-mouth behavior, and may also suck and chew on lead-containing or lead-coated objects, including toys and furniture, and eat lead paint flakes. Workers are also exposed to lead and may bring lead dust home on their clothing.Dealing with legacy lead paint has an estimated cost of USD 1.2-11 billion in the US alone.The authors maintain that legally binding regulatory measures prohibiting lead in paint are key to preventing exposure. Thepolicy briefsummarizes information on the background and rationale for eliminating lead paint and action countries can take, with more detailed information provided in thetechnical brief.The policy brief notes that while international efforts to eliminate lead paint have increased, the need remains for more legally binding control measures. It explains that lead paint laws create incentives for change by encouraging: paint manufacturers to reformulate their paints; ingredient suppliers to produce more and better non-lead ingredients; and paint importers and distributors to sell paints that comply with the laws. The brief also argues that a strong law creates a fair competitive market for paint manufacturers, importers, and exporters, and harmonized lead paint laws among countries can reduce trade barriers.Eliminating lead paint, according to the brief, prevents losses due to reduced productivity and avoids costs of health impacts and of dealing with legacy lead paint. For example, dealing with legacy paint has an estimated cost of between USD 1.2 billion and USD 11 billion in the US. While some initial investment costs are necessary to reformulate paint, many manufacturers, including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have already reformulated their products, viewing it as part of their corporate social responsibility.To develop a lead paint law, the policy brief underscores the need for stakeholder engagement to gain support, and awareness-raising to promote the law’s development and implementation.

59,"19 July 2019: The UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Léo Heller, has proposed a framework for managing and monitoring the impacts of large-scale projects on local populations’ access to potable water and sanitation.His report to the UN General Assembly outlines seven typical stages in the life-cycle of a large-scale “mega-project,” cites examples of impacts from existing projects, including mines, dams, and plantations, and provides questions for duty bearers at each stage, based on existing human rights norms and principles. The report highlights gaps in the existing regulatory framework on mega-projects and a lack of adequate safeguards in implementation.Titled the ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation‘ (A/74/197), the report recognizes seven stages in a mega-project: macro-planning; licensing or approval; planning and design; construction; short-term operation; long-term operation; decommissioning and disaster management.The report recommends that mega-projects avoid impeding physical access to water sources or sanitation facilities and provide alternative services if needed. It calls for identifying affected populations, consulting them in good faith, and initiating projects only with free, prior and informed content (FPIC) of the affected population. Where there are negative impacts, the report calls for redress and reparation measures to be provided in an appropriate and timely manner.Among the gaps noted are the frequent lack of regulation for mega-projects to include a decommissioning stage, although project impacts can continue long into the future.The Special Rapporteur’s report was developed through a consultation process with UN Member States, civil society organizations and businesses. It included written submissions from 33 entities, one public consultation, and two expert consultations in Malaysia and Morocco.Heller notes that mega-projects are often thought to be needed for meeting different SDG targets, including investment in the ‘infrastructure gap.” He argues that capital investors often create increased incentives for States to implement mega-projects and to disregard the concomitant need for human rights protection against impacts such as water pollution and water scarcity due to retention or overuse of water by upstream actors. He adds that human rights defenders who have advocated for the rights of those affected by mega-projects have in the past been harassed, assaulted or even murdered.Heller has served as Special Rapporteur since late 2014.

67,"19 August 2019: The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is proposing a set of principles for protecting freshwater sources, as a basis for promoting resilience and adaptation to climate change. In its ‘Wellspring’ report, the organization warns that current water resource management approaches still focus on “gray solutions” such as dams, reservoirs, and pipes, rather than investing in ecosystems.The report puts forward alternatives to traditional conservation practices and recommends principles for adapting to an uncertain climate future.The 62-page report, titled ‘Wellspring: Source Water Resilience and Climate Adaptation,’ argues that conventional approaches, such as defining targets based on a past ecological baseline, may be counter-productive in the context of a “new normal,” given that climactic conditions may have changed irretrievably.The authors argue instead for applying management principles that will promote the resilience of freshwater ecosystems, referred to as source water protection (SWP). These include: seeking to manage and maintain hydrologic connectivity; avoiding distortions of the natural flow regime; allowing for spatial variation within freshwater ecosystems, for example, allowing rivers to meander rather than be channeled; and managing freshwater ecosystems at the basin scale, based on effective governance and a shared vision.They report identifies activities for protecting freshwater sources in view of the types of climate change impacts they can help address. Land restoration and re-vegetation, including protection of forests, wetlands and grasslands, rank high in terms of climate benefits. Other activities include restoration of riparian zones, sustainable agricultural practices, good practices in ranching activities, fire risk management and roads management. Many of the actions proposed support implementation of SDG target 6.6 on protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes, as well as targets under SDG 15 on terrestrial ecosystems.The report draws on experiences from the Chile, Mexico, Rwanda and the US to develop recommendations for: treating water as a “non-stationary asset” that may represent a shifting baseline; considering upstream-downstream and surface-groundwater interactions to assess and reduce climate-related risks; strengthening existing financing, management and stakeholder institutions through relationships and incentives for adaptive, flexible management; and “welcoming ecosystems into the water management circle” through integrating communities and nature into a common management framework.The report was published byTNCin collaboration with theGlobal Resilience Partnership (GRP)and theAlliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA).

90,"24 October 2019: The UN Secretariat has announced it is organizing a public consultation to generate a global vision for the year 2045, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the UN. The process aims to improve international institutions to meet the aspirations reflected in the 2030 Agenda and bolster the environment for international cooperation.Beginning in January 2020, the UN will convene dialogues around the world with “all segments and generations of society,” with a particular focus on listening to youth and marginalized groups. Discussion moderators will utilize a one-minute survey methodology to create a digital feedback loop. Other methodologies for the consultation include a global scientific survey conducted with the Pew Foundation, and artificial intelligence (AI) “sentiment analysis” of social media feeds. Global Pulse and other partners in the UN system will help with processing the input.Rather than changing public opinion, “we should be letting public opinion change us.”The views and ideas resulting from the dialogues will be presented to world leaders and senior UN officials at a high-profile event on 21 September 2020, when the UN will mark the 75th anniversary of its establishment.Fabrizio Hochschild, UN Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary,briefed reporterson the “UNat75” process on 24 October 2019 – which also marked UN Day. Hochschild said the consultation will focus on three areas:Defining the future we want, looking towards 2045;Identifying global megatrends leading the world away from that vision; andIdeas for improving global cooperation.Hochschild said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres does not see the upcoming anniversary as a moment for celebration, but an impetus to address an unfolding “retreat” from international cooperation and the institutions set up to foster it. Therefore, the UN is holding a conversation, “not one that idealizes our current institutions” but a process to make international cooperation function better. This course correction would focus on gaps between where we are headed if current megatrends continue, and the global aspirations for a better future as reflected in the 2030 Agenda.The views collected will feed into Guterres’ presentation to UN Member States at the anniversary commemoration in September 2020. It will take the form of user-friendly material including a report, films, and broadcast materials aimed at reaching leaders across the world, said Hochschild.TheUNat75 websiteincludes “issue pieces” to spur debate on the key megatrends (climate crisis, inequality, new forms of conflict and violence, rapid changes in demography and digital technologies), a series of videos, and other resources.Asked what should be done to change public opinion in countries where there is low confidence in the UN, Hochschild said that rather than changing public opinion, “we should be letting public opinion change us.” The consultation process is a tool for determining how the UN can and should improve, by gathering critical voices and meet their aspirations, in order to renew current institutions.

97,"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has developed a guidance tool to measure the contribution of the private sector to the SDGs, using 33 SDG indicators. The toolkit is also expected to help raise awareness on the importance of reporting contributions to the SDGs, as called for in SDG target 12.6.UNCTAD developed the tool through a three-year consultation process under the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR). The 36th session of ISAR, which convened from 30 October to 1 November 2019, endorsed the guidance tool. The toolkit is based on key reporting principles and frameworks and companies’ reporting practices.The guidance can help incorporate the private sector’s contributions to SDG implementation into VNRs.The ‘Guidance on core indicators for entity reporting on contribution towards implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals’ features 33 core SDG indicators on economic, environmental, institutional and social areas, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and chemicals, the use of energy and water, waste generation and recycling, gender equality, community development and human resource management. The tool aims to help companies track and report their impacts and progress on SDG targets using comparable and reliable quantitative information. In addition, the tool aims to help governments design policies and develop institutional mechanisms to collect data from companies’ reports to reflect the private sector’s contribution to the SDGs, in line with SDG indicator 12.6.1 (number of companies publishing sustainability reports).In a press release, James Zhan, UNCTAD, emphasized the tool’s potential to promote better coherence between financial and sustainability reporting. Noting that the diversity of reporting frameworks has presented a challenge for government agencies and investors interested in monitoring SDG implementation at the national level, Zhan said the guidance on core indicators for SDG reporting will help harmonize sustainability reporting, and can help incorporate the private sector’s contribution to SDG implementation into voluntary national reviews (VNRs).According to UNCTAD, it has validated the toolkit in China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Guatemala, Kenya, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine. Guatemala’s government agency that promotes small and medium enterprise (SME) development plans will conduct training sessions on SDG reporting for 20-25 companies to help them learn to apply the toolkit.

It identifies climate mitigation measures, climate adaptation measures, cross-cutting measures, and other environmental measures.As of 25 August 2020, the platform lists the measures that 26 countries have taken. The measures are organized by country and are tagged according to whether the measure relates to one of three categories: response, recovery, or redesign, defined as follows:Response: Short-term emergency measures that address concerns that emerged as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic;Recovery: Socioeconomic measures that address medium-term objectives. These measures include an environmental or climate focus to “build back better” from COVID-19.Redesign: Measures taken with a long-term perspective and seeking to prompt paradigm shifts. They focus on “redesigning current socioeconomic and sociocultural systems to be sustainable and resilient.”For example, a climate mitigation action in Sweden categorized as a response, recovery, and redesign measure involves a decision by which the government will invest in night trains to Europe.

It lays out a five-part Action Agenda to “empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs,” which are collectively expressed in the SDGs. These five catalysts are:Aligning the “vast pools” flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs;Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance;Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance;Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs; andAccelerating “lifeblood financing” for small and medium-sized businesses.At the virtual launch of the report, Steiner said “the Task Force was keen to bring back the notion that the citizen is at the center of the economy.

The Platform aims to promote the necessity of addressing ocean and climate issues synergistically and to encourage the incorporation of the ocean in country climate commitments and strategies.The Platform concept note outlines the impacts of climate change on the ocean, and highlights potential marine nature-based solutions. The concept note highlights the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate(SROCC), which warned that the climate impacts on the ocean “are already significant and will be increasingly dangerous” without urgent mitigation and adaptation actions.The concept note further states that through the ‘Because the Ocean’ Declaration, Chile and many other countries have promoted the inclusion of ocean solutions as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

A shared understanding could help ensure a meaningful contribution to the SDGs and hold companies accountable for the social and environmental behavior, the authors argue.The policy brief released on 28 May 2020 titled, ‘How can investors move from greenwashing to SDG-enabling?,’ observes that companies must help build a sustainable world, which they need in order to preserve their long-term financial performance. However, investors may lack tools to measure activity and hold companies accountable. A common definition of Sustainable Development Investment (SDI) would establish norms and minimum thresholds to qualify as aligned with sustainable development. The authors note that the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliancelaunched in October 2019is working on a shared understanding of sustainable investing.The time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.A common definition would need to be followed by strengthened reporting requirements. Regulatory frameworks would “enable a proper assessment of corporate contribution to the SDGs, but also penalize unsustainable practices and discourage short-term thinking in capital markets.”The brief notes that theFinancing for Sustainable Development Report 2020, prepared by over 60 international agencies from the UN system and beyond, recommended the adoption of global mandatory disclosures on climate-related financial risk like those promoted by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).The authors also identify three challenges to sustainability reporting by companies. First, its voluntary nature: “the time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.” Second, the quality and absence of meaningful KPIs that connect to the SDGs; only 23% of multinational companies’ sustainability reports connect the SDGs to numerical performance indicators, and “without numbers, sustainability reporting quickly becomes a public relations exercise.” Third, the variety in type of information, which makes it hard to compare different companies’ data.Finally, the brief notes that Canada has pioneered an approach in which companies receiving financial assistance for crises like the COVID-19 pandemic must commit to stricter reporting requirements on socioeconomic issues, as well as carbon reduction targets.The brief is part of a series aimed at helping policy makers facing difficult choices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The statement highlights CPTPP members’ “commitment to rules-based trade by maintaining open supply chains, active communication, transparency, and prompt notification of trade measures.” It underscores the importance of countering protectionism and reinforcing “an open, effective, fair, inclusive and rules-based trading system to restore economic growth worldwide.”The CPTPP members express their resolve to continue work towards post-COVID-19 economic recovery by establishing and strengthening supply chains, and examining ways the CPTPP could be used to facilitate digital trade responses to COVID-19. The countries commit to avoid “unjustified trade restrictive measures” and to facilitate the flow of essential goods and services during the COVID-19 crisis, including medical supplies and equipment, medicines, and agriculture and food products “in a manner consistent with international trade rules.”The CPTPP members reaffirm their “strong commitment” to upholding and supporting the World Trade Organization (WTO), which “sits at the core of the rules-based Multilateral Trading System.” The countries indicate that they “will work to inject increased momentum into WTO reform, including of its dispute settlement system.”The CPTTP Agreement entered into force on 30 December 2018. The inaugural meeting of the CPTPP Commission took place on 19 January 2019 in Tokyo, Japan, where members discussed elements needed for effective implementation of the Agreement, and how it can be expanded in the future.

150,"17 October 2019: CGIAR announced a global initiative called Crops to End Hunger (CtEH), which will enhance its contributions to the SDGs through high-priority staple crops bred to meet the specific needs of targeted regions and their populations. The initiative is designed to accelerate and modernize how CGIAR and its partners develop, deliver and scale up the use of new crop varieties.CtEH was launched on 17 October 2019, at the World Food Prize’s Borlaug Dialogue in Des Moines, Iowa, US.In 2017 and 2018, a multi-funder group, including the US Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Department for International Development, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research partnered to launch a modernization program for public plant breeding in lower-income countries. The resulting CtEH initiative aims to invigorate breeding for the staple crops most important to smallholder farmers and poor consumers, while supporting CGIAR’s “central role and responsibility” for the conservation and characterization of the world’s crop biodiversity.Twenty CGIAR crops, including cereals, legumes and root crops, were chosen for the breeding initiative, which will develop new varieties to meet the food, nutrition and income needs of producers and consumers, respond to market demands, and provide resilience to pests, diseases and new environmental challenges arising from climate change. The initiative aims to address the “tightly interlinked” challenges of meeting the SDGs on hunger (SDG 2), extreme poverty (SDG 1), and climate change (SDG13).CGIAR notes that the modernization of its breeding programs will provide multiple benefits. For example, the CtEH is expected to increase the rates of “genetic gain” and the scale of impact through the adoption of farmer-preferred, market-demanded and climate-resilient varieties. The initiative will foster closer cooperation between national breeding programs, national research institutes and universities, and small and medium-sized enterprises in the private sector in low-income countries, as well as multilateral seed companies and advanced research institutes. The CtEH will also adopt standardized ways of reporting needs, opportunities and progress, which will provide funders with a transparent view of their return on investment.Ending hunger in our lifetimes is possible, even in the face of the climate emergency, but it requires an urgent transformation of our food system.Speaking on the initiative, Elwyn Grainger-Jones, CGIAR’s Executive Director said that ending hunger in our lifetimes is possible, even in the face of the climate emergency, but that it requires an urgent transformation of our food system, driven by more innovation and partnerships.

165,"12 June 2019: The European Court of Auditors issued a review of the EU’s reporting on SDG achievement and sustainable development, both at the EU level and reporting by individual EU agencies and institutions. The auditors conclude that the EU has not yet created the building blocks for meaningful reporting on sustainability.Eurostat reports on indicators and SDG progress, but does not measure the EU’s contribution to achieving the SDGs.The European Court of Auditors’ report titled, ‘Reporting on Sustainability: A Stocktake of EU Institutions and Agencies,’ observes the EU’s stated commitment to implementing the SDGs, and notes that many EU laws require large companies to report on sustainability. However, the auditors find that the European Commission (EC) is not leading by example on sustainability reporting. Moreover, they observe that the EU lacks a strategy on sustainable development through 2030 that identifies the SDGs relevant for the EU and relevant objectives and targets.The report notes that the Commission’s statistical body, Eurostat, publishes annual reports on indicators and progress related to the SDGs, using statistical information collected by EU member States. It does not, however, measure the contribution of EU budget and policies to sustainable development and achieving the SDGs.The auditors identify two EU institutions and agencies that publish sustainability reports: the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the EU Intellectual Property Office. Reporting by others is “often piecemeal and incomplete and does not cover all aspects of sustainability,” they write. In general, EU institutions and agencies provide information on “how the running of their organization affects sustainability, such as their use of paper or water,” rather than how they consider sustainability in overall operations and strategy. The authors note that the EC has begun to adapt its performance reporting system in the area of external action to the SDGs and sustainability.The auditors further identify challenges related to increasing credibility through audit, noting that sustainability risks can often become financial risks. They argue that external assurance of sustainability reports “can increase credibility and stakeholders’ trust” in information provided and reduce the risk of “greenwashing.” The report highlights some key results of supreme audit institutions (SAI) audits on the SDGs. In Austria, for example, the government adopted a mainstreaming approach to the SDGs, but the Austrian SAI found that the country did not adequately define overall responsibility, resulting in a fragmented implementation process and a lack of coordination in evaluation and reporting.Eva Lindström, European Court of Auditors, said that in light of the EU’s commitment to achieving the SDGs, “we would expect the Commission to be able to report on the results achieved.” Lindström underscored the importance of “reliable information on how the EU contributes” to sustainable development and climate change.

SIWI underscores the need for trust building and better cooperation among water actors, and for linking available technical knowledge with political discussions and decision making.A policy brief titled, ‘Water Diplomacy: Facilitating Dialogues,’ notes that more than 50% of the world’s population relies on freshwater from transboundary basins, yet 60% of international river basins are not covered by any kind of cooperative management framework. The authors draw attention to the promise of multi-track water diplomacy processes, noting that many water diplomacy processes take place in an informal context or through non-state actors. They suggest that, to be effective, water diplomacy processes need to be flexible enough to respond to changing political landscapes and the impacts of climate change, and must take account of available technical knowledge.

The multi-donor Data Financing Facility would build on existing mechanisms and take lessons learned from other global funds.The Bern Network on Financing Data for Development is an open, multi-stakeholder collaboration to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by promoting more and better financing for data. It aims to advance implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data, and is working toward a robust funding framework to be presented at the UN World Data Forum on Sustainable Development Data 2020 in Bern, Switzerland.Launched at the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), the documents highlight that data to understand the scope of low- and middle-income countries’ challenges are still lacking (let alone data on solutions and progress towards the SDGs). The Network calls for a doubling of financial support to statistics, from current levels of about 0.33% official development assistance (ODA) to 0.7%, which the documents note “could achieve significant progress” on the aim of leaving no one behind.The envisioned Facility’s primary aims are: encouraging partner country awareness of and commitment to development data; incentivizing improved in-country investment; and supporting and/or convening research and development initiatives. The one-page summary notes that the Facility could: provide incentives for coordination and alignment with national strategies, which would be an improvement on existing schemes; raise additional domestic and international funds for national statistical authorities; and drive progress towards widely agreed metrics.The Facility would feature two thematic funding windows. The first would provide national statistics offices (NSOs) with a match funding response for critical data capacity gaps. The second would offer seeding, and blend financing for data architecture and service delivery applications.The documents also outline critical actions to strengthen donor coordination on statistics, including:Boosting statistical capacity;Promoting international engagement and standard-setting;Improving coordination for knowledge sharing;Creating pooling arrangements for improved support to development data; andImproving monitoring of investments in data.The release of the paper marks the end of the Bern Network’s technical work, and a shift towards socializing the analysis at key milestones to catalyze change.

180,"9 October 2019: Cities must employ “transformative” climate change adaptation solutions in transitioning to more equitable and sustainable growth, according to a paper published by the World Resources Institute (WRI).The paper titled, ‘Unlocking the Potential for Transformative Climate Adaptation in Cities,’ explains that while cities are increasingly integrating climate adaptation priorities into development policies and plans, a gap remains in understanding the ways in which incremental urban adaptation solutions can lead to more transformative change over the long term. Such change, the paper argues, can improve lives, enhance urban vibrancy, and ensure resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities.The paper explains that transformative adaptation enables cities to achieve synergies across multiple goals, including provision of services and infrastructure, climate change mitigation, ecosystem protection, economic growth and sustainable development objectives at the local level.The paper highlights three action areas to help advance transformative urban adaptation, and their direct and indirect links to each of the SDGs. The action areas are:mainstreaming information on climate risks into planning and delivery of urban infrastructure and services, while strengthening local capacity to act on that information;building climate resilience by upgrading living conditions in vulnerable communities and informal settlements, drawing on local experience and community knowledge; andprioritizing nature-based solutions to holistically manage water and heat risks.To help cities prioritize climate adaptation solutions, according to the paper, the strategies must be integrated with each other, and require common enabling conditions for transformative adaptation in cities, including: strong leadership; inclusion and equity; finance and local capacity; synergies across national, regional and global scales; knowledge, data and partnerships; evaluation and learning; and accountable institutions and governance. The paper also provides detailed recommendations to ensure progress and timescales for each recommendation.The publication was launched at the C40 World Mayors Summit, which convened from 9-12 October in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The IAEG-SDGs is expected to agree on a final set of proposals during its upcoming tenth meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.As part of the 2020 Comprehensive Review of the indicator framework called for in a2017 UN General Assembly resolution, the IAEG held an “open call” in late May and June 2019 for proposed changes to the SDG indicators. It received approximately200 proposalsfor additions, deletions, replacements and revisions to the indicators, including 25 suggestions of additional indicators. IAEG members then reduced this input to53 proposalsfor a consultation held in August and early September 2019.Among those currently proposed for addition are indicators on:SDG 2: anemia, low birthweight and breastfeeding;SDG 3: mental disorders, public spending on primary health care, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR);SDG 4: tertiary education enrollment ratio by sex;SDG 8: energy use by tourism industries;SDG 10: Palma ratio, Gini coefficient and migrant deaths at borders;SDG 13: GHG emissions, GHG concentrations, number of NAPs, and pledges to the Green Climate Fund (GCF);SDG 15: Living Planet Index;SDG 16: refugees as a proportion of origin country’s population; andSDG 17: TOSSD – Total Official Support for Sustainable Development.The comments received on these and other proposals can be seen in the Excel file titled, ‘Compilations of inputs received during the Open Consultation,’ atthis page.IAEG members are reviewing the most recent input and in some cases requesting further information. The Group aims to finalize a revised set of proposals on 21 October 2019 during a one-day meeting open only to IAEG members. Other countries and stakeholders can discuss the resulting proposals during the plenary segment of the meeting taking place from 22-24 October.Following IAEG-SDG 10, the Group will make any needed refinements before submitting its proposal to the UN Statistical Commission ahead of its 51st session in March 2020.The IAEG has set out guiding principles for the 2020 Comprehensive Review process. These include not imposing significant additional burdens on national statistical work, and limiting the scope of changes to keep the overall size of theindicator frameworkapproximately the same. Therefore, it is expected that replacement indicators are more likely to be agreed upon than additional indicators.The tenth IAEG-SDGs meeting (agenda here) also will: consider seven tier reclassification requests based on data availability; discuss work plans for the Tier III indicators not proposed for reclassification nor included in the 2020 review; and discuss data disaggregation, indicators and targets with a 2020 deadline, and “other SDG data initiatives” for monitoring the Goals.The most recent reclassification of an indicator was to SDG indicator 12.6.1 on the number of companies publishing sustainability reports, which was moved from Tier III to Tier II in September 2019.

184,"A report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) investigates the links between gender-based violence (GBV) and environment. The publication lays bare how the struggle for the control of natural resources and environmental pressure and threats exacerbates violence against women and girls.Titled ‘Gender-based Violence and Environment Linkages; The violence of inequality,’ the publication draws from over 1,000 information sources and stakeholder interventions as well as informant interviews and a validation workshop. It also derives from 300 responses to a GBV-Environment survey and a call for case studies that led to 80 submissions addressing both challenges and solutions to the issues.The publication contains three main sections that address the relationship of GBV to: access and control of natural resources; environmental pressures and threats; and environmental action. The first section on access to natural resources discusses land, forests, agriculture and fisheries. It notes that GBV is often employed as a way to maintain power imbalances, violently reinforcing socio-cultural expectations and norms and exacerbating gender inequality.The next section investigates the connections of violence against women and girls to illegal logging, wildlife trade, fishing, and mining, as well as large scale extractive industries, and climate and weather-based disasters. The publication highlights that “competition over scarce resources in and between communities, households and industries amplifies normative, discriminatory and exploitative gender inequalities, giving way to a rise in GBV.” A subsequent discussion of the situation of women environmental rights defenders concludes that “GBV is used to assert power imbalances and, at times, violently discourage or stop women from speaking out for their rights, working toward or benefiting from a safe and healthy environment.”Gender-based abuse across environmental contexts affects the security of nations, communities and individuals, and jeopardizes meeting the SDGs.Overall, the publication concludes that “patterns of gender-based abuse are observed across environmental contexts, affecting the security and well-being of nations, communities and individuals, and jeopardizing meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” The Executive Summary points out, however, that “while linkages between GBV and environmental issues are complex and multi-layered, these threats to human rights and healthy ecosystems are not insurmountable.”The IUCN developed the report in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of the Advancing Gender in the Environment (AGENT) partnership.

Current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trajectories for the ICT sector have been developed by GeSI, GSMA, ITU, and SBTi with support from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Sub-sector trajectories to 2030 have been developed for mobile network operators, fixed network operators, data center operators, user devices and manufacturers of ICT equipment. Each of these is consistent with a climate scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The ICT Sector trajectory calls for a 45% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030.Prompting readers on how to calculate ICT sub-sector targets, the report distinguishes between targets on direct emissions and emissions associated with use of electricity to run operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions respectively), from those covering emissions for a company’s broader value chain (Scope 3).In total, the ICT Sector trajectory calls for a 45% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. While the sector has historically been able to meet capacity and transmission demands, and simultaneously achieve targets through the purchase of renewable energy, the authors note that increasing size and complexity will require greater efforts. The report highlights actions on energy efficiency and encouraging behavior change among end users, in addition to further switching to renewable or low-carbon electricity sources.Additional details on the report’s methodology, as well as emission reduction factors and Scope 3 emissions categories, are available in the report’s annexes.Guidance for further ICT sub-sectors will be covered in a future release.

Each of these is consistent with a climate scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The ICT Sector trajectory calls for a 45% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030.Prompting readers on how to calculate ICT sub-sector targets, the report distinguishes between targets on direct emissions and emissions associated with use of electricity to run operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions respectively), from those covering emissions for a company’s broader value chain (Scope 3).In total, the ICT Sector trajectory calls for a 45% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. While the sector has historically been able to meet capacity and transmission demands, and simultaneously achieve targets through the purchase of renewable energy, the authors note that increasing size and complexity will require greater efforts. The report highlights actions on energy efficiency and encouraging behavior change among end users, in addition to further switching to renewable or low-carbon electricity sources.Additional details on the report’s methodology, as well as emission reduction factors and Scope 3 emissions categories, are available in the report’s annexes.Guidance for further ICT sub-sectors will be covered in a future release.

The Yearbook concludes that progress can be accelerated with “leadership, clarity and ambition from national governments.”The ‘Yearbook of Global Climate Action 2019’ provides an assessment of actions by non-Party stakeholders, defined as regions and cities, businesses and civil society. The report shares examples of regional engagement in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Asia-Pacific that galvanized support for theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, and summarizes subsequent Summit outcomes. The report also showcases examples of practical climate action and lessons learned for local governments, the private sector and other stakeholders, including to help policymakers identify opportunities for incentivizing climate-friendly action.Individual climate-thoughtful choices by everyone can add up to world-saving trends towards climate neutrality.The Yearbook finds that “many areas across all sectors” where “non-Party actors,” often in cooperation with each other and countries, are delivering actions and solutions to increase ambition. If current international cooperative initiative deliver on their goals, they “could close the global gap to the emission trajectory for 2 degrees Celsius of warming in 2030,” although a significant gap would still remain to achieve the 1.5°C goal. The Yearbook highlights the launch of theClimate Ambition Allianceto increase ambition by 2020 and provide leadership on the net-zero emissions by 2050 goal.The Yearbook further highlights the importance of individual behavior in moving towards climate neutrality. It states that “individual climate-thoughtful choices” by everyone can add up to “world-saving trends towards climate neutrality.” Consumer choices on modes of transport, the products they buy and the foods they eat can have a “significant impact” on deforestation, land use, transport emissions, industry transition and capital reallocation.To sufficiently raise climate ambition, the report recommends addressing five challenges. First, the report recommends viewing climate action holistically to realize increased cooperation across sectors and between actors. Second, the report calls for governments to remove barriers to implementation and move away from subsidies and incentives for fossil fuel-related areas and towards incentives for renewable and sustainable solutions to create the conditions needed for non-Party action. Third, the Yearbook highlights the importance of continuing and strengthening the Global Climate Action agenda within the post-2020 UNFCCC process.

The report highlights that civilian deaths in armed conflicts doubled between 2010 and 2016, and that many of these deaths occurred as a result of unmet needs, including access to safe drinking water.The report links WASH in the 2030 Agenda, especially SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, with other UN policy frameworks, namely, the UN ‘Sustaining Peace Agenda’ and the ‘Agenda for Humanity’ that was adopted at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.The report titled,Water Under Fire: Emergencies, development and peace in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, highlights the needs of 420 million children who lack access to basic sanitation, and 210 million who lack access to safe drinking water. The report presents a framework for WASH sector resilience that proposes actions plotted along a conflict continuum, from latent to acute and protracted conflict, through to post-conflict and recovery stages. The WASH agenda, in such contexts, includes early investment to prevent the decline and collapse of the WASH sector, actions to protect long-term water security, and adoption of renewable energy solutions that can continue to power water and sanitation systems during conflict.420 million children lack access to basic sanitation, and 210 million lack access to safe drinking water.Several case studies are presented, including actions to: prevent the spread of cholera in Haiti through agency coordination and focused WASH interventions in cholera hotspots; raising of blended finance from public and private lenders to upgrade water supply systems in Somaliland; and the use of renewable energy to power wastewater treatment in Jordan. The case studies do not provide an unbroken record of success, however, describing barriers and unforeseen circumstances that hampered implementation at different stages.The authors draw attention to the huge amount of capital investment that would be needed to achieve SDG 6 – US$114 billion a year – of which US$60 billion is needed for fragile contexts, and for which insufficient public funds have been raised.

The report describes growing investor appetite to benchmark companies against each other in terms of their SDG performance.The report titled, ‘Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Emerging Trends and Analysis of the SDG Impact of Companies in the S&P 500,’ underscores that the SDGs have become a popular means of communicating a company’s sustainability efforts, and that SDG-aligned language in reporting can attract capital. The S&P 500 is an index measuring the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US.Trucost maps four recent surveys of corporate SDG reporting, conducted by: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) & DNV GL; GlobeScan – SustainAbility; Oxfam; and KPMG. These studies find that many companies report on SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (climate action).However, these Goals do not completely align with companies’ “SDG risk.” The Trucost authors define “SDG risk” as the risk that a company may be directly or indirectly causing a negative impact on the Goal in question, or the risk that a company is dependent on a practice or activity that is in conflict with that Goal. The evaluation of companies’ SDG exposure captures a baseline level of risk related to private sector activities in particular industries and countries.Trucost modelled the risk exposure of companies listed in the S&P 500 using 45 metrics based on the SDGs’ 169 targets. The resulting analysis shows that key risks for these companies lie in issues relating to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). Three of the four surveys find that SDG 15 is one of the least prioritized by businesses.

The report of the UN Secretary-General on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/75/187), issued on 20 July 2020, presents the “imperative” that disability inclusion be incorporated in crisis response, recovery and building back better.The Secretary-General notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened inequalities that were present before the crisis and exposed “the extent of exclusion” faced by persons with disabilities. It also aggravates the multidimensional challenges they face. The report recalls that seven SDG targets make explicit reference to persons with disabilities.The report notes that only 3% of countries have data on persons with disabilities experiencing discrimination. Overall, “the lack of reliable, timely and comparable data related to persons with disabilities further challenges the ability to assess the progress or lack thereof” towards the SDGs.However, the report suggests that an increasing number of countries and international agencies are working to collect disability data, including through new, innovative methodologies. For example, smartphone-based crowdsourcing can provide information on the accessibility of physical spaces around the world. Another positive trend is greater discussion of persons within disabilities within the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) prepared for each session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).Among its recommendations, the report highlights a “twin-track approach” that pairs greater inclusion with targeted effort to address the specific needs of members of marginalized groups. It also recommends that innovations emerging from the COVID-19 era – such as telecommuting and remote learning – be “pursued in a way that helps to advance social inclusion.”Finally, the Secretary-General urges efforts in line with the Inclusive Data Charter adopted in 2018 in order to “compile disability data on a systematic and regular basis globally, regionally and nationally to track progress, identify gaps and facilitate policymaking.” Moreover, broader use of data collection using the Washington Group’s disability questions could be promoted, the report suggests.The report concludes with a set of actions for Member States to consider, in order to mainstream disability and protect the rights of persons with disabilities in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the 2030 Agenda.

235,"Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) has released two reports as part of itsEnergizing Finance series, which track 2018 finance for electricity and clean cooking in the countries with lowest energy access, and identify gaps between commitments and disbursements of development finance for energy. The reports find it will not be possible to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) by 2030 without significant increases in committed investment and improvements in investment disbursement delays.SEforALL partnered with the Climate Policy Initiative to publish the report titled, ‘Understanding the Landscape 2020,’ which tracks finance for electricity and clean cooking committed in 2018 to 20 “high impact countries” (HICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, home to over 80% of the world’s population without energy access. The fourth edition of thisannual reportfinds that 789 million people lack access to electricity, and 2.8 billion people lack access to clean cooking. In 2018, only one-third of the annual USD 41 billion investment required to achieve universal residential electrification and less than 1% of the annual USD 4.5 billion required to achieve universal clean cooking access by 2030 were tracked in the HICs. Additionally, the report notes, investments are not flowing to the countries with the greatest need, nor are energy access investments channeled to the right energy solutions. Investment in fossil fuel-generated electricity increased in 2018, with fossil fuels accounting for the largest portion of electricity finance commitments to HICs for the first time in six years. Overall, the energy access investment portfolio continued to be dominated by a small number of large projects, and capital providers and private sector investments remained elusive in the clean cooking sector. The report concludes with recommendations for policies, regulatory frameworks, institutions, instruments, and business models to accelerate efforts.SEforALL’s second report titled, ‘Missing the Mark 2020,’ identifies the gaps between commitments and disbursements of development finance for energy, as tracked in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System database between 2013-2018. The report finds that although disbursements for energy in HICs have increased at a faster pace than overall development finance disbursements, energy finance disbursements lagged significantly behind commitments of USD 52 billion. Furthermore, aggregate disbursements during the period reviewed of USD 32 billion were insufficient to cover even one year of the annual investment of USD 45 billion necessary to achieve SDG 7 energy access targets. While delays in disbursement have declined since 2002, the report finds delays remained substantial due to cumbersome administrative processes, a lack of capacity among donors and implementing entities, and design flaws that hindered project execution. The report provides recommendations for donors, development finance institutions, and national policymakers to accelerate disbursements and improve the efficacy of energy projects in HICs.

239,"25 September 2019: The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) published a report exploring the potential on green hydrogen. The report notes that hydrogen represents a “complementary solution that is especially relevant for countries with ambitious climate objectives.”The report titled, ‘Hydrogen: A Renewable Energy Perspective,’ examines the potential of hydrogen fuel for hard-to-decarbonize, energy-intensive industries such as trucks, aviation, shipping and heating. In this context, IRENA’s press release on the report highlights its support for the work of the ‘Getting to Zero Coalition’ to achieve carbon emissions cuts in the global shipping sector by 2030.According to the publication, current and future sourcing options for hydrogen are: “gray” (fossil fuel-based); “blue” (fossil fuel-based production with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)); and “green” (renewables-based). Hydrogen’s decarbonization impact depends on how it is produced. For example, as blue hydrogen is not inherently carbon free, its production requires monitoring and verification and certification to account for non-captured emissions and retention of stored carbon dioxide (CO2).The report finds that there are important synergies between hydrogen and renewable energy and that synergies may exist between green and blue hydrogen deployment such as in economies of scale in hydrogen use or hydrogen logistics. It also finds that the cost of hydrogen supply from renewables has come down in recent years and continues to fall.The publication acknowledges that a hydrogen-based energy transition will not happen overnight, and hydrogen use will target specific applications. It concludes that trade of energy-intensive commodities produced with hydrogen, including “e-fuels” may offer an opportunity to accelerate the uptake or renewables and bring wider economic benefits.The report was launched at a side event, hosted by the World Economic Forum (WEF), in conjunction with theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.

242,"10 October 2019: Over 500 participants considered the theme, ‘Mining in a Changing Climate,’ at the 15th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development (IGF). Delegates discussed ways that mining companies are starting to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from mining operations, as well as how they are learning to adapt to changes in climate and the environment, water scarcity, and increased risk of natural disasters.Participants also considered what mining will look like in the future as digital technology changes the way that work is done, the digital economy changes the way that resources may be taxed, and consumers increasingly seek out ethically-sourced products.The three-day event, which convened from 8-10 October 2019, was organized by the IGF Secretariat and hosted by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the Palais des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. The IGF serves as a global venue for dialogue among 74 member country governments, as well as mining companies and industry associations.During the discussion on mining in a changing climate, participants debated,inter alia: whether regulations are needed to supplement and align voluntary mining company initiatives on climate change; whether new governance arrangements need to be developed at the international level; what incentives can push companies to be more ambitious in their climate initiatives; and whether studies already exist on zero-GHG technologies for mining.Among other issues discussed during the 15th AGM were the following:“Climate-smart” mining and “green mines” that use renewable energy, avoid waste generation, and restore degraded land, for example, by reprocessing mine tailings, and capping old tailings mounds to grow vegetables;Concerns whether producer countries, especially African countries, will be able to derive long-term benefits from the “huge increase” in global demand for minerals used in renewable energy technology, and what can be done to promote ownership models that benefit local communities;Post-mining transition strategies, including for coal regions, which would restore environments damaged by mining activities and provide alternative employment for people in local communities;Gender equality issues, including whether women have opportunities to be involved in national and local-level debates around the impacts of mining, whether they benefit from mining activities, and whether they have avenues to report mining-related problems, including problems of gender-based violence;Development of common standards for responsible mining, including the current Global Tailings Review consultation, which seeks to avoid further disasters such as the collapse of the Brumadinho tailings dam in Brazil in early 2019;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), which may allocate “market-facing countries” the right to tax transactions, potentially reducing the revenue received by producer countries; andEfforts to formalize the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, especially from the perspective of eliminating child labor, promoting decent work, and avoiding mercury emissions from artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM).In addition, the Secretariat presented a draft version of the IGF guidance on environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) for comment, prior to its planned release in February 2020.

Overall, it argues for managing water through the lens of climate resilience.The 20-page Water and Climate Policy Brief as launched at a side event organized during the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The brief anticipates that the impacts of climate change will be felt in the increased demand for water for energy, agriculture, industry, and human consumption. Making reasonable trade-offs will be essential; thus, the UN consortium calls for policies that will ensure the representation, participation, behavioral change, and accountability of all stakeholders, as well as adaptation plans that will assist lower-income populations and those who are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. The policy brief further calls for more investment in producing better hydrological data, strengthening institutions and governance of water resources, conducting risk assessments, sharing knowledge, educating water users, and building capacity for better water management.Water is both an enabling and a limiting factor in mitigating and adapting to climate change.At the global and regional levels, UN-Water recommends,inter alia: getting a broader set of national and local government agencies and ministries to participate in the UNFCCC, such as those from water, health, energy, and agriculture sectors; setting global priorities for climate-resilient water and sanitation interventions that will serve the most vulnerable populations, including in areas where there is large-scale human displacement; and ensuring that climate discussions and agreements recognize the role of water in mitigating the impacts of climate change. UN-Water also calls on existing and new climate funds to support resilience building through improved water governance and management.At the national and sub-national levels, UN-Water recommends,inter alia: updating existing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national adaptation plans (NAPs) and other climate-related strategies to incorporate risk-based approaches to water provision and management practices that align with climate targets where appropriate; fostering dialogue among various ministries; and supporting academic research into low-regret, climate-resilient and context-specific water and sanitation infrastructure and technology.The policy brief concludes that water is both an enabling and a limiting factor in mitigating and adapting to climate change.

Level 2 organizational development funding grants are for groups that have grown beyond the start-up phase and are working to create a more sophisticated or permanent structure. Level 3 provides operational funding for climate activists whose organizations are mature and need support for office space, salaries, housing stipends, marketing and communications and other needs.

The letter is addressed to the President of the UN Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) and the co-facilitators of preparations for ECOSOC’s 2020 session of the Financing for Development Forum, which was recently postponed.The letter from the Civil Society FfD Group calls for stepping up multilateral action under the UN, and for steps that “break with normalcy” in line with the UN Secretary-General’s call to move beyond “usual tools” to address the crisis.The coalition proposes refocusing 2020 FfD negotiations on a process to address impacts of the pandemic.It urges an “ambitious UN/FfD-centered process” to assess the global crisis surrounding the pandemic and agree on responses. The Group envisions the process leading to an International Economic Reconstruction and Systemic Reform Summit under the UN, either later in 2020 or in early 2021.The Group proposes that the FfD follow-up process could help raise ambition to remove barriers to socio-economic transformation and promote reforms of global economic frameworks to realign them with human rights, gender justice, decent work, and sustainable development. This would help the international community unlock the means of implementation (MOI) needed to realize the 2030 Agenda.The Group makes six specific proposals:Immediately initiate informal discussions under the leadership of the ECOSOC President and Bureau, on the need for an FfD-centered crisis process;Refocus the second phase of the 2020 outcome negotiations on the rationale, modalities, and agenda for such a process, including possible Conference hosting arrangements;Focus negotiations on addressing key challenges and modalities of preparations for each FfD action area, including any necessary mandates to the Inter-Agency Task Force and FfD Institutional Stakeholders;Request the the Inter-Agency Task Force on FfD to initiate preparations for a special report for the UN/FfD-centered crisis process;Begin online preparations immediately while ensuring that all Member States, including the least developed countries (LDCs), are able to participate effectively and on equal footing, and ensuring full transparency and adequate civil society participation; andFinalize consultations and negotiations in person as soon as physical meetings are possible.TheCivil Society FfD Grouprepresents a wide range of organizations, federations and networks from diverse regions and constituencies around the world, including the Women’s Working Group on FfD. [Civil Society FfD Group Letter]",453,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"A civil society coalition has outlined proposals on the role of the UN’s financing for development (FfD) process in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

267,"The NewClimate Institute has published a report that analyzes the nuances of net-zero targets in order to better enable the identification of truly ambitious actors and offers recommendations for increasing target transparency.The report titled, ‘Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets,’ lauds the accelerating momentum for net-zero targets, noting that the number of net-zero pledges from cities, regions, and companies has about doubled since late 2019. In total, regions, cities, and companies with net-zero targets now represent over 880 million residents, 24.9 million employees, and 10 gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.However, the report warns, nuances in target implementation approaches can determine the extent to which an actor’s target contributes to deep decarbonization. These nuances have implications for the additionality of the impact, the integrity of the actor’s claimed outcome, and the extent to which the approaches support or hinder efforts to solve decarbonization challenges.The report categorizes the nuances according to whether they target the direct reduction of emissions, claim to neutralize emissions through offsetting, or support carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. For example, under the direct reduction of emissions category, the report highlights a broad range of approaches for claiming the neutralization of electricity-related emissions and for supporting the reduction of supply chain and out-of-boundary emissions.The report analyzes the impacts of different types of renewable energy delivery approaches and the risks and opportunities associated with the claiming of offsets in the post-2020 global governance framework under the Paris Agreement on climate change.As uncertainties persist related to methodologies for calculating the climate impact of CO2 removal, the report recommends that these methodologies not be considered as equivalent to direct GHG reductions in claiming neutralization and that actors specify targets for emission reductions and emission removals separately.The report finds that transparency enables accountability, unraveling ambiguity to assist the public in understanding and encourage an actor’s ambition. As transparency enables constructive dialogue about challenges faced, it results in greater solution-oriented ambition than making net-zero claims based in opaque accounting practices, it notes. Conversely, non-transparent net-zero targets can mislead stakeholders about environmental impact, resulting in decisions and behavior that can cause an increase in GHG emissions.The report concludes by listing ten criteria for net-zero target transparency, including recommendations to chart a decarbonization pathway with interim targets and to commit to a timeline to revise and ratchet ambition.The NewClimate Institute supports research and implementation of international action against climate change by generating and sharing knowledge on international climate negotiations, tracking climate action, climate and development, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.In the last year, countries includingChina,Japan, theEU, and theRepublic of Korea, as well asclose to 200 companiesand theNet-Zero Asset Owner Alliancewere among the actors to pledge or announce significant strides towards net-zero targets. [Publication:Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets] [NewClimate Institute Press Release]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",114,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"The NewClimate Institute has published a report that analyzes the nuances of net-zero targets in order to better enable the identification of truly ambitious actors and offers recommendations for increasing target transparency.The report titled, ‘Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets,’ lauds the accelerating momentum for net-zero targets, noting that the number of net-zero pledges from cities, regions, and companies has about doubled since late 2019. In total, regions, cities, and companies with net-zero targets now represent over 880 million residents, 24.9 million employees, and 10 gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.However, the report warns, nuances in target implementation approaches can determine the extent to which an actor’s target contributes to deep decarbonization.

274,"The World Trade Organization (WTO), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and Business Twenty (B20) Saudi Arabia have issued a joint statement that shines a spotlight on “the diminishing availability of trade finance.”The 9 July 2020 statement warns that gaps between current trade finance supply and demand may impede trade’s ability to support COVID-19 recovery efforts. The organizations emphasize that a return to trade-led growth relies on the creation of enabling conditions for businesses to import, export, and service international markets. Trade finance, the statement stresses, is a critical element of such an enabling environment.The statement urges public and private actors to collaborate, and calls for action to address the trade finance shortage. The statement outlines four action areas where the public and private sectors should work together to help fill the gap:Enable a rapid transition to paperless trading;Exchange views on how regulatory authorities could help mitigate constraints to essential trade finance deployment;Share risk to support trade finance; andScale development bank schemes to provide risk mitigation and liquidity for trade finance transactions.Highlighting the scale of the finance gap, the statement points to an ICC estimate that projects that up to USD 5 trillion in financing may be required to support a rapid rebound in global trade flows.

The organizations emphasize that a return to trade-led growth relies on the creation of enabling conditions for businesses to import, export, and service international markets. Trade finance, the statement stresses, is a critical element of such an enabling environment.The statement urges public and private actors to collaborate, and calls for action to address the trade finance shortage. The statement outlines four action areas where the public and private sectors should work together to help fill the gap:Enable a rapid transition to paperless trading;Exchange views on how regulatory authorities could help mitigate constraints to essential trade finance deployment;Share risk to support trade finance; andScale development bank schemes to provide risk mitigation and liquidity for trade finance transactions.Highlighting the scale of the finance gap, the statement points to an ICC estimate that projects that up to USD 5 trillion in financing may be required to support a rapid rebound in global trade flows.

The report also reviews how COVID-19 has hindered global monitoring of climate change and finds that, despite a temporary decline, global emissions are on track to return to pre-pandemic levels.Key findings address emissions trends and current and projected impacts of climate change. The WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch states that although sustained reductions in emissions are required to achieve the targets established by the Paris Agreement on climate change, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) continued to increase in 2019 and 2020, with overall 2020 emissions decreases leading to only a small reduction in the annual increase of the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs.GCP finds that emissions growth slowed to 1% per year in the 2010s, down from 3% annual growth in the 2000s, but warns that declining annual emissions occurring in the early 2010s later increased.WMO and the UK Met Office note that the 2016-2020 average global mean surface temperature will be among the warmest five-year periods on record, 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. The organizations warn that there is a 24% chance that in the five-year period 2020-2023 at least one year could exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Although daily global fossil CO2 emissions fell by 17% during peak pandemic lock-down in April 2020, GCP finds that average 2020 CO2 emissions will only fall by 4-9% compared to 2019.The report includes overviews from the IPCC and WMO on the impact of climate change on oceans, the cryosphere, and water resources. It also reviews UNEP’s tenthEmissions Gap Report,which found that annual cuts in global emissions from 2020-2030 would have to be nearly 3% to achieve a 2°C target and over 7% to limit warming to 1.5°C, equal to the combined emissions of the six largest emitters.UNESCO-IOC and WMO caution that hindrances to climate change monitoring in 2020 will introduce gaps in historical time series needed to monitor climate variability, change, and associated impacts, with long-term potential effects on climate trend data collection and analysis.

The case study on Namibia is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.According to the case study, Namibia has a fully integrated civil registration and identity management system that registers, processes, and updates the identity information of citizens, permanent residents, and refugees – the National Population Registration System (NPRS). The NPRS was created by combining various databases that held different types of personal information linked by a unique identification number (UIN).The publication notes that, even though Namibia still faces challenges in ensuring that marriage and divorce registrations are complete, major progress was made when birth and death registration became a key prerequisite for offering social grants. This tactic allowed Namibian authorities to incentivize the demand side of the registration process.The authors highlight that adopting information and communication technology (ICT) was essential to building the NPRS, as it helped integrate and launch electronic birth and death notification platforms. The case study underscores that, if adopted correctly and applied to redesigned business processes, ICT can deliver an overarching and interoperable population register that serves an effective tool for delivering high-impact services for governance and public administration.

279,"Finland has communicated its long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategy (LEDS) to the UNFCCC. Finland’s LEDS charts scenarios and impact assessments to achieve its 2035 carbon neutrality target, and reviews longer-term emissions reduction and removal opportunities by 2050.The LEDS assesses Finland’s emissions reduction potential and needs by sector in three scenarios concerning the country’s 2035 carbon neutrality target. The reference scenario reviews development that would be achievable with current policy measures in place. It determines that carbon neutrality would not be possible until 2050, and even then only by leveraging 30 MtCO2eq of land use net sinks.The ‘Continuous Growth’ scenario achieves an 87.5% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The corresponding target under the ‘Savings’ scenario achieves 90% GHG emission reductions. Both achieve carbon neutrality in 2035, and exclude the land-use sector from calculations. Neither scenario sets carbon-negative targets beyond 2035, rather they allow this level “to be determined by the size of the net carbon sink of the land use sector.” The Continuous Growth and Savings scenarios differ in their underlying technology assumptions, most significantly the viability of carbon capture and storage (CCS), as well as increases in energy efficiency and sustainable biorefinery production. The difference in the scenarios is also accounted for by differing assumptions on the structures of industry, society, and the economy as a whole.The LEDS analyzes the emissions reduction potential and needs of the energy, industry, transport, waste, and land use sectors. The Strategy does not specifically identify the sectors to which emission reductions should be allocated, nor does it include quantitative analysis of specific policies needed to achieve the 2035 and 2050 targets. These, it states, will be decided in 2020-2021 as part of the country’s process of drafting the Climate and Energy Strategy, the Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan, the roadmap for fossil-free transport, and the climate programme for the land use sector.

The SEI working paper reveals that activities proposed in countries’ NDCs most prominently cover six SDGs:SDG 2 (zero hunger);SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);SDG 15 (life on land); andSDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).In addition, several climate activities contribute “to a limited extent” to the following SDGs:SDG 3 (good health and well-being);SDG 4 (quality education);SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure);SDG 13 (climate action); andSDG 14 (life below water).The paper further notes that some SDGs are “far less connected” with NDC activities, and focus mainly on the social and political issues. These are: SDG 1 (no poverty); SDG 5 (gender equality); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). For instance, the authors reveal that only 2% of total NDC activities address SDG 1, and they call on policymakers to take into account the adverse effects of climate change on poor households, such as measures that can affect the poor by raising prices through energy or carbon taxes, or by using more expensive technologies for electricity production.The authors also find that evidence of effective orchestration between NDCs and the SDGs is largely absent at the national level. Per them, an integrated approach offers greater leverage for advancing the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, as it simultaneously allows governments to step up ambition and impact, and to avoid costly and counterproductive trade-offs.

285,"The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) has published a policy brief that addresses chemicals of concern in products, and efforts to minimize their adverse effects on human health and the environment. The policy brief titled, ‘Understanding Chemicals in Products,’ is a contribution from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded project on ‘Global Best Practices on Emerging Chemical Policy Issues of Concern under SAICM.’The policy brief notes that transparency of information about chemicals in global supply chains has been an emerging policy issue since 2009, leading to, for example, the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Chemicals in Products (CiP) programme, which focuses on the textiles, toys, electronics and building materials sectors. In 2015, SAICM welcomed CiP and proposed cooperative actions to address information gaps, focusing on the four sectors as documentation of hazardous chemicals often does not exist or is not available outside supply chains. According to SAICM, information exchange helps identify and address chemicals of concern in products, particularly for manufacturers, retailers and consumers.Chemicals of concern intoysoften enter the lifecycle during plastic production, painting and coating, or through recycled materials. Exposure can result in long-term health effects for children, interfering with the hormone system or learning abilities. Specific chemicals of concern include persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from recycled plastic, cadmium in batteries and lead paint, among others.Electronicscontain valuable materials such as metals, which make recycling attractive. Reuse and repair are also common, particularly for high-value products such as medical equipment. However, during the end-of-life and production stages, e-waste is often shipped to developing countries where workers recovering resources of value are exposed to toxic substances. Chemicals of concern include flame retardants in insulation and mercury in switches, as well as  worker exposure to benzene in factories.Potential sources of hazardous chemicals inbuilding materialsinclude use of recycled materials and performance-enhancing substances, which are costly to remove and may affect construction workers and expose inhabitants to indoor pollution.

In 2015, SAICM welcomed CiP and proposed cooperative actions to address information gaps, focusing on the four sectors as documentation of hazardous chemicals often does not exist or is not available outside supply chains. According to SAICM, information exchange helps identify and address chemicals of concern in products, particularly for manufacturers, retailers and consumers.Chemicals of concern intoysoften enter the lifecycle during plastic production, painting and coating, or through recycled materials. Exposure can result in long-term health effects for children, interfering with the hormone system or learning abilities. Specific chemicals of concern include persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from recycled plastic, cadmium in batteries and lead paint, among others.Electronicscontain valuable materials such as metals, which make recycling attractive. Reuse and repair are also common, particularly for high-value products such as medical equipment. However, during the end-of-life and production stages, e-waste is often shipped to developing countries where workers recovering resources of value are exposed to toxic substances. Chemicals of concern include flame retardants in insulation and mercury in switches, as well as  worker exposure to benzene in factories.Potential sources of hazardous chemicals inbuilding materialsinclude use of recycled materials and performance-enhancing substances, which are costly to remove and may affect construction workers and expose inhabitants to indoor pollution.

291,"18 June 2019: For a region that is home to 55% of the world’s population, but accounts for only 18% of global forests, coordinated approaches are urgently needed to reverse biodiversity loss and manage the “special interest trade-offs [that] will, in many cases, be inevitable.” This is one of the key messages contained in the report titled, ‘Forest Futures: Sustainable Pathways for Forests, Landscapes and People in the Asia-Pacific Region,’ published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).The publication is structured around three main sections: an overview of Asia-Pacific forests in a larger landscape context; an examination of the key drivers of change with impacts on forests and forestry; and an exploration of three scenarios, “business-as-usual, aspirational and disruptive,” for 2030 and 2050 to support decision making and action by policymakers and other stakeholders.Young people can shape a sustainable future by changing rigid institutions from within by shaking them up.The report notes that while there has been an overall increase in the area of forests set aside for biodiversity conservation since 2000, “development first” still dominates policy narratives in the Asia-Pacific region, limiting the scope to prevent further biodiversity losses. The report identifies continued population rise, coupled with economic growth and purchasing power, as one of the most significant drivers of change in the sector. It further notes that the resulting changes in land use, as well as other “stressors” such as climate change and infrastructure development conflict, are contributing to declining ecosystem resilience in natural forests, along with the deteriorating capacity of these forests to deliver essential ecosystem services such as water and soil protection, climate regulation, cultural values, and wood, food and medicines.To avoid the “environmental catastrophe” that is likely to result, the report stresses that all actors will need to commit to transformational change that includes “working cross-sectorally and across borders, investing massively to restore forests and landscapes, reforming forest tenure and outdated institutions, empowering communities, and embracing innovation.”The report makes particular note of the role of young people in realizing a more aspirational outcome for the region. Referencing the contributions of around 300 forestry students and young professionals from more than 30 countries that were consulted for the study, the report highlights young people’s confidence that they can shape a sustainable future by taking leadership roles, generating momentum through collaboration and social media and “changing rigid institutions from within by shaking them up.”FAO completed the first Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study (APFSOS I) in 1998 and APFSOS II in 2010.

306,"7 October 2019: An amended Gothenburg Protocol has entered into force, making it the first binding agreement to target emission reductions for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP).The Protocol sets binding emission reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond for major air pollutants, and was negotiated under the UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) Convention  on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). The Protocol was updated in 2012 to include the reduction of PM2.5, thus addressing air pollution and climate change policies in an integrated manner. The amendments to the Protocol entered into force on 7 October 2019.Reducing PM2.5 levels, specifically black carbon, helps combat climate change. Black carbon traps 680 times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2). It has darkened snow and ice in the Arctic region, and contributed to regional warming.The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol is the first agreement to target multiple air pollutants and their sources.The Protocol also sets emission reduction limits for sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3) and ground-level ozone (O3) precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds, which can have long-term health effects even with mild exposure, are released from,inter alia, motor fuel combustion, heat and power generation, and cooking and heating fuels.Implementing the amended Protocol’s emission reduction measures are estimated to cost less than 0.01% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the EU, making it a cost-effective policy solution, given that healthcare and lost workday costs due to air pollution are estimated at between 2.5% and 7% of GDP per year in Western Europe and above 20% of GDP per year for countries in the pan-European region.Closely linked to climate change, air pollution, which kills seven million people every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is the world’s largest single environmental health risk. It is a leading cause of death by cancer and a major cause of environmental degradation, threatening almost two-thirds of Europe’s ecosystems, and presents a critical barrier for sustainable development.The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone was the first agreement to target multiple air pollutants and their sources, including combustion plants, electricity production, agriculture, cars and lorries. Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the US and the EU have ratified the Protocol. Additional UNECE member States are expected to ratify the Protocol in the coming months.The 1979 LRTAP Convention has 51 Parties, covering North America and almost the entire European continent, and eight protocols, which have helped to decouple emissions and economic growth, reduce certain air pollutants by 40 to 80%, recover forest soils from acidification, and avoid approximately 600,000 premature deaths per year.

It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds,inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; andin the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure.

321,"19 September 2019: The Coalition for Urban Transitions has published a report that show that transitioning to zero-carbon, climate-resilient cities can help achieve national economic prosperity and improve quality of life, while tackling climate change at the same time.The report titled, ‘Climate Emergency: Urban Opportunity: How National Governments Can Secure Economic Prosperity and Avert Climate Catastrophe by Transforming Cities,’ underscores the social and economic benefits of creating net-zero-emission cities, and presents a six-point action plan for national governments. The report concludes that national governments can achieve faster, fairer economic development by investing in zero-carbon cities and that investments in low-carbon measures in cities will be worth at least USD 23.9 trillion by 2050.The six priorities for national action detailed in the report are:developing a strategy to deliver shared prosperity while achieving net zero emissions, focused on compact, connected, clean cities and a partnership between national and local governments;aligning national policies behind cities through,inter alia, removing land-use and building regulations that limit higher density, reforming energy markets to decarbonize the electricity grid, reaching net zero operating emissions in buildings with minimal use of carbon offsets, banning the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles and adopting green alternatives to steel and cement;funding and financing sustainable urban infrastructure through, for example, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, establishing a carbon price of USD 40-80 per tonne, scaling land-based financing instruments to fund sustainable urban infrastructure and limit sprawl, and funding for public transport;coordinating and supporting local climate action in cities through,inter alia, authorizing local governments to introduce climate policies that are more ambitious than national policies, and allocating at least a third of national research and development budgets to support cities’ climate priorities;building a multilateral system that fosters inclusive, zero-carbon cities through, among other measures, scaling up climate action in cities in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), requiring international financial institutions to halt fossil fuel financing and ensuring that international development assistance is aligned with national urban strategies that are compatible with the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; andproactively planning for a just urban transition through strengthening tenure security for the urban poor, enhancing climate resilience and gender equality through educating youth, using revenues from fossil fuel subsidy reform or carbon taxes to compensate people who bear the costs of climate action, and supporting the future workforce, including by helping with the transition of fossil fuel-based workers and industries.The report, which was released on 19 September 2019, represents a collaborative effort of more than 50 organizations.

The updated principles and criteria reflect expanded coverage of marine biodiversity and sustainable tourism, as well as “the climate emergency.”The BioTrade Initiative aims to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through promoting trade and investment in BioTrade products and services. Companies, governments, and other stakeholders apply the principles to conduct the sourcing, production, and commercialization of goods and services derived from native biodiversity (ecosystems, species, and genetic resources) according to environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The BioTrade principles and criteria are based on the value-chain approach, adaptive management approach, ecosystem approach, and sustainable livelihoods.

The report responds to a request from the WTO’s LDC Group to analyze how graduation will impact countries’ trade relations.LDCs enjoy exclusive preferences in the implementation of WTO rules and disciplines and in market access. Once they graduate, LDCs lose this special treatment. There are currently 47 LDCs, 12 of which are at different stages of the graduation process. Angola, Bangladesh, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, Nepal, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are WTO members while Bhutan, Sao Tome and Principe, and Timor-Leste are in the process of negotiating their WTO accession. Kiribati and Tuvalu are on the graduation path but are not WTO members.The report titled, ‘Trade Impacts of LDC Graduation,’ emphasizes the significant contribution of trade to enabling graduating LDCs to reach graduation thresholds. The report finds that graduating LDCs have “diverse economic profiles” with differences in their export structure and their utilization of and reliance on preferential market access. Further, LDCs also have varied terms of entry into the WTO; therefore, graduation will affect graduating LDCs in different ways, and support should therefore be “tailored to the needs and development strategy of each country.”The report concludes that the impact of graduation “appears limited” for most graduating LDCs, with only “marginal increases in tariffs” due to the loss of preferences. The report finds that the biggest impact is likely to be limited to a few export items, such as clothing, fish products, and footwear, that go to a few developed country markets (Canada, the EU, and Japan).The report considers possible actions graduating governments may need to take to adhere to their new non-LDC obligations, including identifying potential support measures that graduating LDCs can build on by working with their development partners to ensure sustainable graduation. The report also suggests graduating governments consider forging appropriate trading arrangements with trading partners and become familiar with options to seek recourse to WTO procedures and instruments if they face difficulties in meeting commitments.The WTO developed the report with theEnhanced Integrated Framework(EIF) as part of a joint project, ‘Trade Impacts of LDC Graduation.’ The WTO and EIF completed the report before the COVID-19 pandemic and recent trade forecasts that predict a “sharp downturn in global trade this year.” Although the report does not consider the impact of COVID-19 on LDCs, the WTO emphasizes in a press release that it remains important for understanding the trade impacts resulting from graduation.

The report aims to arm industry leaders with recommendations for supporting healthy and sustainable diets along with sustainable food production methods and supply chains.The Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment (CCSI), the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the Santa Chiara Lab of the University of Siena prepared the report, which launched on 24 September 2019, at the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).The publication explains that current land-use and food systems contribute to “widespread” hunger, malnutrition and obesity. In addition, food systems account for approximately one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, over 90% of scarcity-weighted water use, most losses of biodiversity, over-exploitation of fisheries, nutrient overload in the water, and air and water pollution. At the same time, the report notes, food systems are highly vulnerable to climate change and land degradation. After providing an analysis of how the food industry currently operates, the publication provides recommendations on how to adapt the industry to current planetary challenges such as climate change, urbanization, ocean pollution and population growth.The report provides good practices and recommendations in four areas: promoting and developing healthy and sustainable diets; identifying sustainable ways to produce food; developing sustainable food supply chains; and being a good corporate citizen. It then makes the case for a change in business practices and more harmonized and comparable monitoring and reporting standards, explaining that comparability will support the efforts by companies to set more ambitious targets in the four areas.The publication marks the first phase of a two-year project to identify effective sustainability pathways towards the achievement of the SDGs by the industry. The second phase will consist of engaging with industry leaders to promote the systematization and upgrade of their practices, reporting, monitoring, and public education efforts in alignment with the SDGs.

The report evaluates the country’s progress towards each of the SDGs, and offers recommendations on how to improve implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Kyrgyzstan.The report by the Forum of Women’s NGOs of Kyrgyzstan titled, ‘Review of the Implementation of the SDG in the Kyrgyz Republic,’ commends Kyrgyzstan’s VNR for including problems and commitments on the next steps for each SDG. It notes that CSOs “made a significant contribution to the fairly high level of objectivity of the report.” At the same time, the CSO warn that the VNR “didn’t cover all aspects of the commitments taken” by Kyrgyzstan within the framework of the 2030 Agenda.The report notes that Kyrgyzstan is behind on almost all of the SDGs. It identifies integration and coordination, short-term approaches, insufficient capacity of the public sector, and weak accountability from the government among the key problems, and highlights COVID-19 impacts on SDG achievement in the country. It also finds that the VNR leaves means of implementation “without serious attention.”The CSOs rate Kyrgyzstan’s progress on each of the Goals on a scale from one to five according to eight criteria of the Action for Sustainable Development (A4SD) People’s Scorecard 2020: 1) availability of a policy or legal framework; 2) plans and strategies; 3) commitment by government agencies; 4) implementation; 5) capacity building; 6) monitoring, evaluation, and reporting; 7) transparency and accountability; and 8) overall progress. For example, on SDG 5 (gender equality), Kyrgyzstan has a score of four in terms of policy or legal framework availability but only two for implementation, capacity building, and overall progress, among other parameters. The report warns that many Goals are “rated below average in terms of achievement.”The CSO report offers 16 recommendations for the government to achieve better implementation of the 2030 Agenda, including:Develop a plan to address problems related to SDG implementation, with annual operational reporting;Ensure institutionalized participation of CSOs in further planning, implementation, and monitoring of SDG implementation;Introduce multi-stakeholder partnership as a mandatory approach to achieve all Goals;Develop mechanisms for introducing the necessary means of implementation for each Goal; andImprove the quality of indicators for each Goal and introduce specific indicators of success.The report was produced with support from A4SD, the Sigrid Rausing Trust, and the Global Fund for Women.

368,"23 August 2019: The Government of Canada has conducted a gender-based analysis plus (GBA+) on a potential free trade agreement (FTA) between Canada and the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. This is the first time such an analysis has been carried out on an ongoing free trade negotiation.In March 2018, the Government of Canada committed to conduct an expanded impact assessment on the Mercosur FTA negotiations, including examining potential impacts on gender and labor using a GBA approach. GBA is a tool used to analyze the potential opportunities and impacts of a government policy, programme or other initiative on people, including women, indigenous peoples and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The tool aims to help support Canada’s inclusive approach to trade, which emphasizes that the benefits and opportunities resulting from FTAs should be widely shared among diverse groups of people.The gender-based analysis aims to address trade and economic development in a way that benefits more Canadians, said Jim Carr.The initial summary of the GBA+ includes an economic impact assessment that considers gross domestic product (GDP) gains, trade gains, job and wage gains, income inequality, gendered impacts, labor force participation, youth and SMEs. On income inequality, for example, the analysis finds that real wage gains are likely to be strongest in percentage terms for manual laborers and machinery operators, whose wages would grow at a faster pace than those of workers in managerial, professional and technical groups, which would therefore help mitigate income inequality in Canada and support wider benefits from trade.For youth, the proposed FTA is estimated to result in higher employment as a result of a rise in new job market opportunities. Similarly, the proposed FTA is likely to add more jobs for female workers, contributing to their expanded role in the labor force. The summary concludes that the proposed FTA would generate economic benefits for both economies, including “positive effects for under-represented groups in Canada’s economy,” promoting gender balance in the economy, encouraging youth employment and increasing the number of SMEs in Canada.The GBA summary is expected to inform the ongoing negotiations and help identify opportunities to add new gender-responsive and inclusive trade provisions across the FTA.

372,"23 September 2019: A coalition of countries, businesses and institutions has announced its commitment to putting in place ambitious policies to help drive a 3% annual global increase in energy efficiency. The coalition reports that this target, which was announced at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, is necessary to meet global climate goals while enhancing economic prosperity in all countries.The ‘Three Percent Club’ brings together 15 governments (Argentina, Colombia, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Portugal, Senegal and the UK) and 13 businesses and international organizations to help put the world on a path to achieve the necessary annual energy efficiency improvements to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change.Energy efficiency can help reduce emissions while improving people’s well-being.Coalition participants will share and provide technical and financial support, including by leveraging the combined global resources of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the International Energy Agency (IEA), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) Energy Efficiency Accelerators and Hub, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Energy Efficiency Global Alliance.“Energy efficiency is the one energy resource that all countries share in abundance, and it can help reduce emissions while improving people’s well-being,” said Fatih Birol, Executive Director, IEA.A Climate Action Summit press release notes that energy efficiency has the potential of delivering 40% of the emission reductions required to meet global climate goals.

The report finds that governments representing 50% of the world’s population have set an explicit national target in line with SDG target 12.3. However, governments representing just 12% of the population are measuring food loss and waste, and countries representing just 15% of the world’s population are pursuing reduction actions at scale.Further the report highlights that of the world’s 50 largest food companies, more than two-thirds have set goals in line with SDG target 12.3, more than 40% are measuring their food loss and waste, and one-third are pursuing actions at scale to reduce waste in their own operations.The report urges governments to set ambitious targets and “act boldly” to reduce food loss and waste, especially because such commitments could also spur progress towards the Paris Agreement on climate change as well as other agreed development goals and priorities.The Champions 12.3 summit also featured announcements towards achieving SDG target 12.3. Some of the highlights came from a newly launched ‘10x20x30’ initiative, the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) and the World Bank.The 10x20x30 initiative will convene ten of the world’s biggest food retailers and providers to each engage with 20 of their priority suppliers to halve their rates of food loss and waste by 2030. Founding partners are AEON, Ahold Delhaize, IKEA Food, Kroger, METRO AG, Pick n Pay, The Savola Group, Sodexo, Tesco, and Walmart. Five of the ten are the largest food retailers in the world.The SRP – a global multi-stakeholder alliance including some of the world’s leading rice producers and buyers, including Olam, Mars Food, Loc Troi, Ebro Foods, SunRice, LT Foods, and Phoenix Global – set a target, and called upon its members and the wider industry to commit to halving post-harvest rice loss and waste by 2030. Its commitments include developing a taskforce and roadmap of best practices to achieve the 50% reduction.The World Bank reported that it raised USD 1 billion for sustainable development bonds addressing food loss and waste, since March 2019. A separatepress releasediscusses the World Bank’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) launch of Sustainable Development Bonds totaling USD 500 million. The Norinchukin Bank, a national-level financial institution for agricultural, fishery and forestry cooperatives in Japan, was the sole investor.

386,"The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has launched a Global Framework for Urban Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), which offers a strategic vision for urban WASH programming across global, regional, and country levels. Through the Framework, UNICEF intends to increase its engagement in urban areas and create a common vision for its approach to urban programming that focuses on marginalized children and their families.The Framework, which was published in February 2020, is based on UNICEF’s experiences in urban WASH programming in over 50 countries, and came about as a result of: expanding urban populations with unequal access to WASH services; the need for universal access to water and sanitation to achieve the SDGs; and the fact that poor WASH services threaten public health, especially in high-density urban areas.Although children in urban areas tend to have better access to WASH than their rural counterparts, inequalities are stark, with the poorest often having little or no ability to use these basic services. This is particularly the case for children living in slums and other impoverished urban settlements. In addition, the impacts of climate change, environmental hazards, and natural disasters are magnified in such settlement, which often face overcrowding, lack of urban planning, and vulnerable WASH infrastructures. These realities exacerbate children’s vulnerabilities and lack of access, and have driven the focus on meeting urban WASH needs.The Framework is meant to be used by regional and country offices to develop more localized, context-specific urban WASH frameworks and strategies for urban slums, small towns, and urban areas in humanitarian and protracted crisis settings. It provides opportunities for partnerships and is structured around support at the sector, service, and user levels, with suggested entry points and activities for engagement.At the ‘sector level,’ support comprises UNICEF interventions at the national (sector) level, aimed at supporting governments and partnering with other organizations to strengthen the enabling environment to deliver effective, sustainable, and inclusive urban WASH interventions. Such interventions include: evidence generation and analysis; institutional support and coordination; sector financing; capacity development; and planning, monitoring, and review.At the ‘service level,’ support encompasses UNICEF’s work to improve the delivery of WASH to the urban population through formal, informal, private, or public service providers, and regulators. Priority entry points for this support include: supporting service delivery mechanisms to reach the poorest populations; supporting demand and supply approaches for urban WASH; and promoting poor-inclusive financing strategies for inclusive urban WASH services.Finally, ‘user-level’ support focuses on: empowering communities and families, and increasing their access to WASH services, and their capacity to engage with service providers and policymakers. Achieving this, the Framework notes, requires encouraging low-income urban communities to participate in planning and implementation of WASH services and strengthening accountability structures. [UN-Water] [Global Framework for Urban WASH Landing Page] [Summary of the Global Framework for Urban WASH] [Global Framework for Urban WASH]",432,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has launched a Global Framework for Urban Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), which offers a strategic vision for urban WASH programming across global, regional, and country levels. Through the Framework, UNICEF intends to increase its engagement in urban areas and create a common vision for its approach to urban programming that focuses on marginalized children and their families.The Framework, which was published in February 2020, is based on UNICEF’s experiences in urban WASH programming in over 50 countries, and came about as a result of: expanding urban populations with unequal access to WASH services; the need for universal access to water and sanitation to achieve the SDGs; and the fact that poor WASH services threaten public health, especially in high-density urban areas.Although children in urban areas tend to have better access to WASH than their rural counterparts, inequalities are stark, with the poorest often having little or no ability to use these basic services. This is particularly the case for children living in slums and other impoverished urban settlements. In addition, the impacts of climate change, environmental hazards, and natural disasters are magnified in such settlement, which often face overcrowding, lack of urban planning, and vulnerable WASH infrastructures. These realities exacerbate children’s vulnerabilities and lack of access, and have driven the focus on meeting urban WASH needs.The Framework is meant to be used by regional and country offices to develop more localized, context-specific urban WASH frameworks and strategies for urban slums, small towns, and urban areas in humanitarian and protracted crisis settings.

387,"The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) released the latest edition of their joint publication on employment in the region, with findings pointing to the importance of addressing gender gaps in the labor market to achieve the SDGs. The authors stress the critical role of women’s access to paid employment in helping the region to reduce poverty, tackle inequality and ensure economic growth.The report titled, ‘Employment Situation in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evolution of and prospects for women’s labour participation in Latin America,’ identifies a “large increase” in women’s participation in paid activities as one of the most important trends in the region’s labor market (although the report cautions that greater participation in the labor market does not necessarily result in greater quality of life or greater quality of employment). The average participation rate for women 15 years and older increased by 11 percentage points in Latin America over the past 30 years, the largest increase globally. Countries with the highest female labor participation rate are Peru, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Paraguay. Countries with the lowest rates are Guatemala (39.2%), Mexico (43.5%) and Costa Rica (45.1%). Despite these overall gains, female labor participation in the region remains “significantly behind developed countries.” The gap between women’s labor participation rate and men’s labor participation was 25.9 percentage points in 2018, on average.Better quality jobs are “losing ground” against sectors with more informal labor conditions.Large differences also exist among countries in terms of the levels of female labor participation and the pace of growth. Women’s participation in the labor market in rural areas increased in some countries – including Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic – but decreased in Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Guatemala and Peru.The publication recognizes Latin America’s progress on a number of factors that positively affect women’s decision to participate in the labor market, including social norms and political rights. Additional factors include equal access to education, improved reproductive services and a decline in the fertility rate, and greater average levels of income. Increased access to technologies also has reduced the amount of time women spend on domestic tasks, and increased flexibility in the place, form and modality of work. However, the report finds that the region still lags behind in some areas that could hinder growth in female labor participation, including cultural attitudes that promote reproductive and caring roles for women, and gender gaps in expected economic returns on education.The report also examines the region’s labor market performance during the first half of 2019. Low economic growth affected job creation, and the average regional urban unemployment rate in the region remained steady at 10.1%. The authors conclude that the job categories and sectors that typically create better quality jobs are “losing ground” against sectors with more informal labor conditions.The report is prepared twice yearly by ECLAC’s Economic Development Division and the ILO’s Office for the Southern Cone of Latin America.

The report finds that rapid breakthroughs in the areas of energy, industry, transport, human settlements, ocean and coastal zones, water, nature-based solutions and land use, and climate resilience are approaching “the tipping points necessary to reach zero emissions by 2050.”The ‘Climate Action Pathways’ seek to provide a “blueprint” to coordinate climate action by cities, regions, businesses, and investors in the runup to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021. The pathways identify the near- and long-term milestones for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in each of the eight sectors considered. They provide an overview of “synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas that assist all actors to take an integrated approach.”As an example, the transformational actions and milestones needed to achieve zero-carbon economy for ocean and coastal zones include:Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are ended by 2021, and science-based management is implemented to restore fish stocks in the shortest time possible;30% of fully and highly protected marine protected areas are designated and implemented by 2030;Resilience and adaptive capacity of ocean-dependent coastal communities (fisheries and aquaculture) are increased, and vulnerability assessments are conducted by 2025; andStable market of zero-carbon fuels is ensured by 2030.Speaking at the launch, High-Level Climate Champion Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) underscored the need for “a major transition, from where we are today to where we need to be by 2050” to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. “[I]t is vital that we have a clear map of the route ahead,” he said.The Climate Action Pathways, which complement theYearbook of Global Climate Action, were unveiled during theRace to Zero Dialogues, running from 9-19 November 2020.
