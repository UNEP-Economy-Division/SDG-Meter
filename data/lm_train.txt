Parties to the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted a guidance document on integrated sustainable nitrogen management, aiming to address the pollution problems that nitrogen causes in the global biosphere.The Executive Body of the Convention adopted the guidance on 18 December 2020. It aims to help governments and farmers reduce nitrogen waste into air and water and keep more nitrogen on farms, where it can bring benefits for food production, the economy, the environment, and human health.Because better nitrogen management would yield multiple co-benefits, it is a way to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs within the SDGs.The Guidance identifies co-benefits of controlling air pollution in the areas of climate, water, biodiversity, health, and the economy. It also identifies 24 principles to help Parties understand and tailor solutions.UNECE reports that human activities over the last century have more than doubled the total amount of nitrogen introduced into the global biosphere. The resulting problems include air pollution, water pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, stratospheric ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, and soil acidification.The lead author of the guidance, Mark Sutton, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said the Guidance brings together, for the first time, nitrogen losses relevant for air, climate, and water. Through this integrated approach, he argues that “with sound nitrogen management, not only will air and water quality benefit, but it’ll help mitigate climate change as well.”Sutton said that because better nitrogen management would yield multiple co-benefits, it is a way to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs within the SDGs.

23 September 2019: The Government of Uruguay has developed a climate action plan to deal with the impacts of climate change faced by the agriculture sector, which will also help the country achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and the SDGs.The ‘Uruguayan National Adaptation Plan to Climate Variability and Change for the Agricultural Sector’ (NAP-Agro) proposes a strategy for 2050 and an action plan for 2025, with adaptation measures focused on production systems, ecosystems and natural resources, livelihoods and institutional capacities.The Plan seeks to increase the adaptive capacity and resilience and improve the livelihoods of rural populations through adopting sustainable animal and plant production systems, developing and transferring technology, information systems, climate insurance, resilient infrastructure, promoting best practices, supporting networks and organizations of farmers and strengthening institutional capacities for adaptation.The NAP-Agro was developed following a decade of studies and research that helped improve decision making on adaptation actions and formulate the NAP. Studies include: a case study on Uruguay, ‘Safeguarding Livelihoods and Promoting Resilience Through National Adaptation Plans,’ and ‘Making the Case for Gender-responsive Adaptation Planning in Uruguay: The Importance of Sex-disaggregated Data’; guides onapplying cost-benefit analysisto adaptation measures in agriculture and forestimating losses and damagesdue to extreme climatic events in agriculture (in Spanish); and studies ongender and adaptationto climate change in agriculture and onclimate projectionsthrough statistical downscaling (in Spanish).The formulation of the NAP-Agro is the result of a three-year participatory process, which involved more than 950 people, to identify, order and prioritize climate actions. In 2017, a consultation process through a series of Adaptation Dialogues involved more than 200 people from the private and public sectors, academia and civil society. These Dialogues identified impacts of climate variability and change and priority adaptation strategies focusing on different productive systems, rural women and family farming. Adaptation workshops also took place in agricultural high schools across Uruguay, with nearly 450 youth participating. In July, the draft NAP-Agro received comments from stakeholders from public agricultural institutions, subnational governments, civil society, farmer organizations and academia.The process was led by the Office of Agricultural Programming and Policy of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, in coordination with the National System of Response to Climate Change and Variability. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) provided technical support, under the Integrating Agriculture into National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Program funded by the Government of Germany.

The Government of Mexico has published a report that quantifies co-benefits from implementing the climate agenda in coordination with the sustainable development agenda in the country.The report titled, ‘Crunching Numbers: Quantifying the Sustainable Development Co-benefits of Mexico’s Climate Commitments,’ measures priority co-benefits resulting from implementing current and potential commitments in Mexico’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the UNFCCC, arguing that climate action and development policies should be harmonized and integrated because they reinforce each other and achieve more together.The report quantifies social, economic and environmental co-benefits of climate action in various sectors and their impact for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It argues that climate action is a “lever” that enables achievement of the SDGs, and explains that the relationship between sustainable development and climate change goes beyond SDG 13 (climate action).The study identifies six co-benefits resulting from implementing three current and two potential NDC commitments and their contribution to the SDGs. The NDC commitments analyzed are:achieving 43% of electricity generation from clean sources by 2030 (existing NDC);achieving a net-zero deforestation rate by 2030 (existing NDC);guaranteeing and monitoring the treatment of urban and industrial wastewater in human settlements larger than 500,000 inhabitants (existing NDC);achieving 500,000 electric vehicle sales in Mexico by 2030 (potential NDC); andreducing energy demand in the three most energy-intensive industrial sectors, namely cement (by 1.8%), chemicals (by 9.6%) and iron and steel (by 14.7%) by 2030 (potential NDC).According to the report, implementation of these commitments could result in the following co-benefits: improving livelihoods and community resilience; improved public health; increased food security; improved conditions of water resources; employment creation; and contributing to energy security.As an example, the report explains that achieving Mexico’s electricity generation NDC goal can catalyze social development through improvements in public health, which can contribute to SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and save USD 2.7 billion between 2019-2030 of funds usually spent to treat air pollution-related diseases.Understanding and measuring such co-benefits, the report notes, helps identify opportunities to accelerate progress in both agendas, by guiding decision making, avoiding duplication of efforts and reducing implementation costs. Mexico, according to the report, has the institutional capacity to achieve both the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda if mitigation and adaptation are mainstreamed into development planning.The report was commissioned by the Mexican Office of the Presidency, with support from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

3 October 2019: Rainforest Foundation Norway has released a report that analyzes the impacts of the aviation industry’s emissions reduction goals on deforestation. The report cautions that the production of alternative aviation fuels is likely to drive forest clearance and generate carbon dioxide emissions from land use change, underscoring how emissions reductions goals in one sector can have a negative impact on others.The report titled, ‘Destination deforestation: Aviation biofuels, vegetable oil and land use change,’ explains that the aviation industry aims to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% in 2050, compared to the 2005 level, without limiting growth. The aviation industry plans to work towards this goal by shifting from conventional jet fuel to alternative aviation fuels. According to Rainforest Foundation Norway’s report, the only current technology operating at a commercial scale to produce aviation fuel from electricity is the ‘hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, or HEFA’ process, which produces jet fuel from animal fats and vegetable oils. The report raises concerns about the cost of fuels produced using HEFA or other alternatives and cautions that the HEFA industry’s sustainability and scalability is limited by the need for feedstock inputs, such as palm oil and soy oil, both of which are associated with tropical deforestation.The report questions “whether current rates of aviation growth can ever be sustainable in a carbon constrained world.”Based on the aviation industry’s projected fuel needs, the report states that, if palm and soy oils each contribute a quarter of the feedstock demand for the aviation industry goal, it “could drive 3.2 million hectares of forest loss and 5 gigatonnes of land use change carbon dioxide emissions.” The report concludes that the HEFA technology is “simply not appropriate to delivering the volumes […] needed for a large-scale transition to alternative fuels in the aviation industry” and therefore recommends identifying more commercially viable and scalable technology options. Within this context, the report questions “whether current rates of aviation growth can ever be sustainable in a carbon constrained world.”To avoid undermining the SDGs and limit global temperature rise, the report argues the aviation industry should avoid using biofuels from feedstocks, such as palm oil and soy, that have a high deforestation risk. The report therefore recommends reassessing the realistic potential for alternative aviation fuel deployment between now and 2050. The report further recommends,inter alia: focusing on mobilizing investment for demonstrating the potential of electrofuels and cellulosic biofuels at commercial scale; and reprioritizing additional options to decarbonize aviation, including electric propulsion and novel airframes.

17 July 2019: A World Resources Institute (WRI) publication proposes a five-course ‘menu of solutions’ to ensure food security for 10 billion people by 2050 without increasing emissions, fueling deforestation or exacerbating poverty. The report underscores that the global food system must undergo “urgent change” to ensure adequate food for everyone without destroying the environment.‘The World Resources Report: Creating a Sustainable Food Future’ was produced by WRI in partnership with the World Bank, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Development Programme (UNDP), and France’s Agricultural Research for Development (CIRAD) and National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). Many of the report’s findings use the new GlobAgri-WRR model, which quantifies how much every proposed “menu item” can help increase the availability of food, avoid deforestation, and reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. The publication also identifies policies, innovations, and incentives that can take the proposed solutions to scale.The report highlights three gaps that need to be closed to achieve sustainable food systems: a 56% “food gap” between what was produced in 2010 and food that will be needed in 2050; a nearly 600 million-hectare “land gap” (an area nearly twice the size of India) between global agricultural land area in 2010 and expected agricultural expansion by 2050; and an 11-gigaton “GHGs mitigation gap” between expected emissions from agriculture in 2050 and the level needed to meet the Paris Agreement.To close these gaps, the publication calls for major adjustments in the production of food and in people’s consumption, and gives policymakers, businesses, and researchers a roadmap for measures spanning wild fisheries management to beef consumption. The report explores a 22-item “menu for a sustainable food future,” which is divided into “five courses” that together could close the three identified gaps.They include: (1) Reduce growth in demand by cutting food loss and waste, eating healthier diets, and more; (2) Increase food production without expanding agricultural land area via yield gains for both crops and livestock; (3) Protect and restore natural ecosystems by reducing deforestation, restoring peatlands, and linking yield gains with ecosystem conservation; (4) Increase fish supply by improving aquaculture systems and better managing wild fisheries; and (4) Reduce GHGs emissions from agricultural production through innovative technologies and farming methods.The report argues that shifting consumption patterns, increasing the productivity of crops and livestock, and improving the efficiency of inputs like fertilizers could significantly reduce emissions and the demand for land while raising agricultural incomes. In addition, the text notes that maintaining global warming below a 1.5°C increase above pre-industrial levels would require reforesting more than 585 million hectares made available by these demand- and supply-side efficiency gains.

A series of articles by experts and officials highlight current issues related to public institutions and governance, including messages from a regional workshop on governance for sustainable development in Africa. The articles are published on the blog of the UN Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government, which is part of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).An article by Louis Meuleman, Rapporteur of the UN Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), discusses the importance of reforming public institutions in order to achieve sustainable development. Reflecting on arecent workshopon governance for sustainable development organized by DESA and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), Meuleman writes that participating governments, UN agencies, civil society, academia and others expressed that they are clear on the needed policies and models to leave no one behind. However, they need more answers regarding the “how” of reforming public administration and governance. Meuleman’s recommendations include:Recognize that effective governance requires adaptation to its specific context, and develop “steering, incentivizing and collaboration mechanisms”;Ensure that rapid reforms do not take place “at the expense of strategic foresight, back-casting or impact analysis”;Establish training for public officials in “sustainability transformation acceleration”; andImplement thePrinciples of Effective Governance for Sustainable Development, which were formulated by CEPA and endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 2018.An article by Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, CEPA Chairperson, further elaborates on discussions at the Africa workshop. Other articles in the DPIDG blog series highlight: a five-step strategy for overcoming digital divides, by Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist; and recommended actions for public institutions to scale up services for poor and vulnerable groups, by Maria-Francesca Spatolisano, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs.

2 August 2019: Held in the North Pacific and Western Pacific Marginal Seas region, the second regional workshop on the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) discussed solution-focused research strategies. Over 160 participants from 18 countries contributed to the three-day workshop by reflecting on science actions and identifying opportunities to support the Decade’s objectives and six societal outcomes.The Decade is galvanizing ocean stakeholders around the world behind a common framework to ensure that ocean science supports countries in achieving the SDGs, and it is supporting efforts to reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health. Its six societal outcomes include a clean ocean, a healthy and resilient ocean, a predicted ocean, a safe ocean, a sustainably harvested and productive ocean, and a transparent ocean, and accessible ocean.Participants referred to the Decade as a “once-in-in a lifetime opportunity to shape a better ocean science agenda.”The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) organized the workshop, which took place in Tokyo, Japan, to prepare for the upcoming Decade through engagement with different stakeholders in the region. According to UNESCO, the North and West Pacific region has a population of more than three billion people, making it the most densely populated area in the world. Activities that threaten the health and productivity of the ocean in the region include land-based pollution, increasing economic development and non-sustainable resource extraction, climate change, and habitat destruction. Human activities have also impacted local marine ecosystems and coastal waters.Workshop participants shared their perspective on the Decade, underscoring it as a “once-in-in a lifetime opportunity to shape a better ocean science agenda” and connect ocean science more closely to society. The workshop agreed on a range of actions and partnerships to promote the sustainable development of the worlds’ oceans.The UN held the first regional consultation on the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) in the South Pacific region, from 23-25 July 2019.

The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) has launched a website, ‘Sustainable Recovery 2020,’ and a corresponding campaign. In response to the economic stimulus packages launched in 2020, the campaign advocates for public spending that minimizes impacts on nature, accounts for climate risks, improves social cohesion, and stimulates green innovation.The ‘IISD Sustainable Recovery 2020 campaign’ website serves as a resource for those focused on pandemic response measures. It features simulations, commentaries, and blogs that highlight how to achieve a sustainable recovery. Using the ‘Sustainable Asset Valuation,’ (SAVi), the campaign is working to analyze societal impacts of green stimulus packages and measures, such as stimulus finding for climate-resilient retrofits of buildings and energy efficiency.One section of the project “tracks the trackers.” This section includes profiles and links to trackers that other organizations have created to monitor recovery and stimulus measures from governments and public institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The website also links to IISD’s ‘Sustainable Infrastructure Finance Portal,’ which presents a repository of news and perspectives on how sustainable infrastructure can serve as a catalyst for the SDGs. Articles address a range of topics, from news stories on the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects report and the role of public sector support in large-scale solar PV to a webinar on financing nature-based solutions.Upcoming webinars will address opportunities for a green recovery in Sri Lanka and perspectives on sustainable recovery in India.

The Chilean Presidency of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC announced a renewed Climate Ambition Alliance, in which participating countries commit to accelerate action by 2020 and achieve net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050.UN Secretary-General António Guterres asked Chile to lead the Climate Ambition Alliance in the context of government’s role as the original host of COP25. During the September 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, President of Chile Sebastián Piñeralaunchedthe Alliance to accelerate the transformation needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and stabilize the global average temperature rise at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.In addition to 73 UNFCCC parties, 14 regions, 398 cities, 768 businesses and 16 investors are working to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.At the Climate Ambition event on the sidelines ofCOP 25in Madrid, Spain, Chile’s Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt said73 countrieshave “signaled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action plan” to the UNFCCC. She announced that an additional 11 countries have initiated an internal process to enhance ambition and to reflect this enhanced ambition in their national plans by 2020. Schmidt further announced that 73 parties to the UNFCCC, 14 regions, 398 cities, 768 businesses and 16 investors are working to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.The Alliance will also focus on implementing measures to strengthen the protection of forests and oceans. On adaptation, the Alliance will galvanize actions to improve water management, resilient infrastructure and sustainable cities.Schmidt observed that more leaders are joining this effort to show “that boosting NDC ambition is both necessary and possible.” She said Chile and the UK will work to mobilize additional actors to join the Alliance ahead of the next UNFCCC COP, which will meet in Glasgow, UK (COP 26).In Chile’s press release, COP 26 President Designate Claire O’Neill stressed the UK’s commitment to work together to tackle climate change, and called on every country to “come forward as soon as possible in 2020 with a more ambitious NDC.” UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa told Parties that joining the Alliance is a “concrete way to demonstrate that the world is united behind the imperative to boost ambition” and to “publicly commit to enhancing their national climate plans by 2020.”Addressing the event, Guterressaidhe is “deeply encouraged” by the Alliance’s growth, noting that the “shift from the grey to the green economy is on, and it is gathering pace.” He stressed that countries must honor their pledges to scale up national climate commitments every five years to reach “what the scientific community has defined as a must”: reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Guterres said the world’s biggest emitters must do much more, and will be a “top priority over the next 12 months.” [Chile Press Release]
The third brief in IISD’s ‘Still Only One Earth’ series highlights that illegal wildlife trade can lead to the spread of zoonoses, such as SARS-CoV-2 that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.The policy brief titled, ‘The Evolving War on Illegal Wildlife Trade,’ is authored by Tanya Rosen. Rosen reports that the world’s more “charismatic” species as well as lesser known ones are suffering unprecedented declines due to trafficking and unsustainable trade in wildlife commodities including elephant ivory, rhino horn, pangolin scales, tiger bone, and bear bile. Wildlife crime is the fourth-largest illegal global trade, she notes, following narcotics, counterfeiting, and human trafficking.The focus of the policy brief series is on lessons from sustainable policy and governance, and Rosen explores the effectiveness of the only existing international convention to address trade in wild specimens of flora and fauna – the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The brief notes that many species being illegally traded are not listed through CITES, and that enforcement is challenged by the lack of an agreed definition of wildlife crime. An emerging challenge for CITES amid COVID-19 is that the prospect of further restricting wildlife trade could “send that trade underground.” Rosen notes that the threat of more pandemics “looms large,” and is expected to affect conservation and efforts to curb illegal wildlife trade.The brief concludes with a recommendation: while countries may be willing to enter into a new, stronger agreement, they should first consider whether CITES can further adapt to better curb illegal wildlife trade and address the challenges brought by COVID-19.The policy brief series draws on the environmental negotiation insights of the globalENB team. The briefs aim to guide future efforts to address the causes of climate change, support the sustainable management of natural resources, and foster fair and sustainable economies. [Publication:The Evolving War on Illegal Wildlife Trade] [Still Only One Earth series] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on launch of series]

UN-Water hasconsolidatedwater and sanitation-related resources related to stopping the transmission of COVID-19. The resources provided by several UN-Water Members and Partners overview the key ways in which water and sanitation are key to stopping the virus.Many of the resources address the importance of hand washing, specifically hand washing with soap. Theynotethat only three out of five people worldwide have basic hand washing facilities.Articles regarding the importance of water and sanitation for vulnerable groups,such asrefugees, migrants, and stateless, are featured. In herarticle, Cecilia Jimenez-Damary, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, calls attention to the needs of internally displaced persons, noting that they are at “heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to limited access to healthcare, water, sanitation, food and adequate housing, and often face discrimination.”In anotherarticle, UN-Habitat addresses the need for water to wash hands in slums. To meet this challenge, the UN agency suggests introducing emergency safe drinking water and hand washing facilities in key locations in informal settlements and high-density public places. It also recommends engaging community leaders and groups through existing slum networks, youth centers, as well as using networks to train community volunteers and establish and manage hand washing facilities.Guidelines specific to water and sanitation measures, and infection prevention, forschools,households and public places, andhealth care facilitiesare also provided. Further, a separatearticlereveals that the novel coronavirus has been detected in wastewater in the Netherlands.Another article, on the impacts on global security, reviews the ways in which the Water, Peace and Security (WPS) partnership’sWPS Global Toolcan be used to cross-reference data related to conflict and protest events with conflict and risk drivers, such as water scarcity.
The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) published a policy brief on lessons learned since 2006, to inform discussions on future arrangements of SAICM and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020.The brief, which was released in April 2020, explains that, while SAICM has m­­­ade significant progress regarding strengthening capacity, commitment, technical knowledge, and political will to implement and mainstream chemicals into national planning, its objectives and 2020 goal to minimize the adverse impacts of chemicals and waste will not be achieved.More ambitious action is needed, and the brief describes progress made and considerations in moving beyond 2020 related to:reducing the widening gap between countries;inspiring political will to act at national levels;sharing knowledge and information;securing stable finances and resources;strengthening collaboration and including all stakeholders in SAICM’s process, work and structure;improving the monitoring framework to assess progress; andaddressing emerging policy issues (EPIs).On reducing inequality between developed and developing countries and addressing human rights issues, the brief emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable and marginalized groups from chemicals exposure at work, in the home and in the environment, including through the provision of technical infrastructure, such as poison centers, and strengthened collaboration between actors in chemicals management and human rights focusing on gendered impacts of exposure and childhood exposure.Regarding inspiring political will, considerations in moving beyond 2020 include, among others: building National Focal Point (NFP) capacity so they can fulfill mandates and encourage stakeholder buy-in and mobilization of resources; increasing ownership of SAICM to encourage implementation of the integrated approach to financing; and improving representation of health, agriculture, finance, and other relevant sectors to support national efforts to mainstream SAICM across departments.Regarding sharing knowledge and information, the brief mentions: establishing a global system to share and fill information gaps on hazardous chemicals and waste; and creating a scientific forum with the potential to develop internationally agreed methodologies for risk and hazard assessment.On securing stable finances and resources, the policy brief underlines the need to: mainstream SAICM’s strategic objectives into national development plans and budgets; and utilize economic instruments, such as the ‘polluter pays principle,’ to address externalities resulting from chemicals production, use and disposal.On strengthening collaboration and including all stakeholders in SAICM’s process, work and structure, recommendations include enhancing linkages and collaboration between sectors to support efforts to mainstream SAICM across government departments and create linkages to each country-levelUN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.The document also discusses improving the monitoring framework to assess progress by strengthening linkages to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and developing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic and Time-bound) indicators to complement or replace existing indicators.On emerging policy issues (EPIs), recommendations include recognizing ‘highly hazardous pesticides’ as an EPI, and agreeing on the most suitable testing regime for endocrine disrupting chemicals. [Publication:Policy Brief: Lessons from the past to inform SAICM and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020]
The World Trade Organization (WTO), the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and the International Trade Centre (ITC) have developed an online portal that collates progress on trade-related SDGs.TheSDG Trade Monitorwas launched at WTO headquarters on World Statistics Day on 20 October.The portal aims to improve users’ understanding of the relationship between trade and sustainable development by enabling customized analysis of the trade-related SDG indicators and highlighting the latest progress in achieving the relevant SDG targets.Speaking at the launch event, WTO Deputy Director-General Yonov Frederick Agah emphasized the role of trade as “an engine for economic growth” that “has unlocked massive poverty reduction gains and socio-economic development across the globe, particularly in developing countries.” He said the multi-agency collaboration proves that “multilateral efforts in trade are possible and worthwhile.”UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant described the SDG Trade Monitor as a “one-stop-shop” where users can “obtain the most updated, official figures of trade-related SDG indicators.”ITC Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton identified trade as “one of the most crucial means of implementing the SDGs.”The SDG Trade Monitor gathers data on:SDG target 2.b, on correcting and preventing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets;SDG target 8.a, on increasingAid for Tradesupport for developing countries, in particular least developed countries (LDCs);SDG target 10.a, on implementing the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries and LDCs;SDG target 17.10, on promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system (MTS);SDG target 17.11, on increasing the exports of developing countries and LDCs; andSDG target 17.12, on implementing long-term, duty-free, and quota-free market access for all LDCs.[WTO Press Release] [SDG Trade Monitor]
18 July 2019: During an event on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), Alamine Ousmane Mey, Minister of Economy, Planning and Regional Development, Cameroon, presented the country’s first Voluntary National Review (VNR).The event, organized by the Government of Cameroon, took place on 18 July 2019. Mey explained that the methodology adopted for Cameroon’s VNR was based on normative, participatory and inclusive approaches.For the coming years, Cameroon has prioritized: intensification of national ownership of the SDGs; establishment of a national multi-stakeholder monitoring framework to act as a review and accountability platform for SDG implementation; and elaboration of strategies to increase partnerships and mobilize financial resources for SDG implementation.Mey said that the VNR focuses on, among others, the SDGs that HLPF 2019 reviewed.For example, on SDGs 4 (quality education), he cited an increase in student enrollment and progress regarding access, expansion and reduction of disparities in education. He said student completion rates during the first cycle of the secondary level improved from 53.2% in 2015 to 80% in 2018. However, emphasizing a focus on primary education in particular, he acknowledged deteriorating primary level completion rates and pupil-teacher ratio, and that security tensions disrupt education efforts.On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Mey cited average economic growth of 4% per year, and said the government is working to achieve the 7% economic growth rate required to meet the SDGs.He said achieving SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) remains a challenge for Cameroon, and mentioned efforts to enhance social safety nets and policies that increase the number of beneficiaries and progressively increase minimum wages.For SDG 13 (climate action), May underscored the creation of an inter-ministerial committee to follow-up on implementation of the Paris Agreement, and drew attention to the challenge of mobilizing resources to implement National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and to finance alternative activities to deforestation.On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), he stressed the need to reinforce trust and confidence in national institutions for greater efficiency, inclusion and justice.On challenges related to SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mey emphasized ensuring large-scale mobilization of multiple stakeholders, promoting a fair and inclusive digital economy and improving economic competitiveness.Mey also supported,inter alia, strengthening statistics for better monitoring; transferring competences to local authorities; and scaling up finance management to promote local resilience and poverty reduction.A video presentation showcased actions in Cameroon on promoting decent jobs, climate action, peace to achieve social reconciliation, and disarmament. During the discussion, a representative from Cameroon underlined the importance of intensifying national ownership to accelerate the integration of SDGs into.IISD Reporting Services coveredselected side eventsduring HLPF 2019.

September 2019: In a briefing note, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has assessed the readiness of 159 countries to leave no one behind (LNOB), using its 2019 LNOB index. The 159 countries include 87 countries that presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018, and 72 countries that presented or will present their VNRs in 2019 and 2020.Resource challenges beset readiness aspects, not only outcomes, of the 2030 Agenda.The 159 countries assessed include 24 low-income countries, 41 lower middle-income countries, 45 upper- middle-income countries, and 49 high-income countries. They were evaluated using three thematic components of the 2019 LNOB index, namely:Data – to assesses whether countries are undertaking the surveys necessary to identify those at high risk of being left behind;Policy – to assess whether countries have key policies in place to address the needs of those at risk of being left behind (such as women’s access to land, anti-discrimination labor laws and universal access to health); andFinance – to determine whether governments invest adequately in education, health and social protection, which are three sectors key to supporting those at high risk of being left behind.Thenote, written by Soumya Chattopadhyay and Stephanie Manea, finds that 81 countries are ready to meet their LNOB commitment, 54 are partially ready and 12 are not ready. In addition, data are insufficient for assessing 12 countries.The authors also find that most high- and upper-middle-income countries have already achieved “ready” status, but lower-middle- and low-income countries are lagging behind. They argue that this highlights a resource challenge that besets both readiness and outcome aspects of the 2030 Agenda.The note also concludes that:The readiness status of 12 countries has worsened, compared to ODI’s 2018 LNOB assessment, while only six have improved;On the data, policy and finance components measured, 102 countries are data-ready, while only 47 countries are ready in the policy dimension, and 45 in the finance dimension; andFollowing the 2018 index, most improvements are seen in the data dimension, and reflect an increase in the availability of household survey data.Before the release of the 2019 edition of the index, the 2018 version and an accompanying briefing note werelaunchedin the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2019.

The IISD has published a policy brief on the role of finance and technology in achieving sustainable development. The brief warns that while the world has enough money to fund sustainable development, there is a financing gap and a persistent digital divide to achieve the SDGs.The brief, authored by Elena Kosolapova, argues that “technology, finance, and capacity building, together with inclusive and equitable globalization and trade, regional integration, and enabling environments” can help address climate change, biodiversity loss, growing inequalities, poverty, and hunger, among other challenges. It acknowledges that without transferring technological and financial resources to developing countries, the world cannot achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.The brief traces the history of sustainable development finance since the UN Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, and outlines the current global regulatory landscape for financing sustainable development and climate action, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the Paris Agreement.According to the brief, “financing remains a major bottleneck”— a challenge exacerbated by “slow growth, high debt, growing trade restrictions, increasing environmental shocks, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” It argues the world could bridge the financing gap to achieve the SDGs, estimated at between USD 2.5 and USD 3 trillion per year, if about 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) went to sustainable development. However, “‘substantial backsliding in key action areas’ has been observed,” the brief warns, including a drop in official development assistance (ODA) of 4.3% in 2018, and a decrease in ODA to least developed countries (LDCs) of 2.2% in real terms. The brief notes that “developed countries’ pledge of raising USD 100 billion per year in climate finance has also proven difficult to achieve.”The brief outlines “persistent gaps” between developed and developing countries’ access to and use of existing technologies, and points to “a persistent digital divide.” Recognizing technologies’ potential to “promote sustainable development and leave no one behind,” the brief cautions about possible risks that could compromise achievement of the SDGs, such as exacerbated inequalities and job loss, and recommends any tradeoffs be addressed.Improved alignment between development cooperation and climate action, the brief argues, “can help ensure development financing activities do not undermine sustainable development,” which, it says, can be achieved though leadership, renewed commitment, political will, and global partnership.The brief was published as part of the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series, which assesses “the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy,” focusing on climate action,sustainable energy,wildlife trade, andbiodiversity, among other issues.

12 July 2019: An event on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) addressed opportunities and challenges regarding the digital revolution and sustainable development. The side event was presented by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and The World in 2050 (TWI2050) research initiative.The 12 July event in New York, US affirmed that: the digital revolution is a driving force of societal transformation; references to digitalization are lacking in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change; and transformation towards sustainability must be harmonized with the threats, opportunities and dynamics of the digital revolution, the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.Panelists highlighted that data-driven interdisciplinarity and development of national data platforms, such as theAfrican Open Science Platform, are priorities for greater synergies between digitization and the SDGs. Speakers emphasized ways in which digitization could help support a green economy, calling for technologies that support measuring and monitoring the Global Goals.The event also highlighted areportreleased by TWI2050 titled, ‘Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges,’ which describes the ways in which digitalization can transform the world. The report aims to bridge the gaps between digitization and sustainability, and outlines six transformation areas:human capacity and demography through further improvements of education and health care;responsible consumption and production through the adoption of a circular economy approach and reducing demand;decarbonization of energy systems through energy efficiency, more renewables and electrification;more efficient and sustainable food systems by increasing agricultural productivity and access to nutritional food and clean water, while protecting the biosphere and oceans;smart cities development through smart infrastructure, decent housing and high connectivity; andthe digital revolution as a sustainable development driver.The event also highlighted challenges related to digitalization that may have unsustainable effects related to structural unemployment and proliferation of autonomous weapons. In the ensuing debate, participants highlighted concerns regarding the speed of technological disruption, as well as the “digital divide” as it contributes to social inequalities. They agreed that digitalization can help resolve sustainability challenges and drive disruptive change, and called for building responsible knowledge societies capable of taking action towards sustainability in the new digital era.IISD Reporting Services is coveringselected side eventsduring the HLPF 2019.

The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published it latest Interim Economic Outlook, which warns that the coronavirus (COVID-19) presents the global economy with its greatest threat since the financial crisis.The Outlook, titled, ‘Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk,’ investigates best- and worst-case scenarios and calls on governments to act immediately to limit the spread of the virus, protect people and businesses from its effects, and strengthen economic demand.The report notes that broader spread of the virus across the wider Asia-Pacific region and advanced economies could result in global growth as low as 1.5% this year, cutting in half the OECD’s 2020 projection from November 2019. Containment measures and loss of confidence could reduce production and spending and lead to a recession in some countries.G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus.The report calls for flexible working situations to keep as many jobs as possible, and implementation of temporary tax and budgetary measures to soften the impact in affected sectors, such as travel and tourism. The OECD also calls for adequate liquidity in the most affected countries to enable banks to help companies with cash-flow problems while containing the virus.The report points out that the G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence. The Outlook concludes that,inter alia:contractions in China are being felt globally, reflecting China’s critical role in global supply chains, travel and commodity market;outbreaks in other economies are having similar effects;prospects for China have been revised, with growth slipping below 5% in 2020, before recovering to over 6% in 2021, as output returns to levels projected prior to the outbreak of the virus;the adverse impacts on confidence, financial markets, the travel sector and disruption to supply chains contribute to the downward revisions in all G20 economies in 2020; anda longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America could cause global growth could drop to 1.5% in 2020, half the projected rate prior to the outbreak.The Outlook calls for: ensuring well-resourced public health measures to prevent infection and contagion; implementing policies that support health care systems and workers; and protecting incomes of vulnerable social groups and businesses. The report further states that macroeconomic policies can help restore confidence and demand recovery as outbreaks ease, but that it cannot offset immediate disruptions from enforced shutdowns and travel restrictions. If growth is weaker for an extended period of time, coordinated multilateral action will be required. [OECD News Story] [Publication Landing Page] [Publication:Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk]
The High-level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda (FACTI) is holding global public consultations on ways to release more resources to finance the SDGs.The 15-member FACTI Panel wasannouncedin January 2020 andlaunchedon 2 March 2020 by the Presidents of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).The Panel is organizing its work into three clusters, according to thesummaryof the Panel’s initial video conference on 31 March.Improve cooperation in tax matters: fostering universal participation in international legal instruments on tax matters; further work on tax avoidance and evasion; preparing consistent and reliable global data on taxation;Accountability, public reporting and anti-corruption measures: promoting accountability in contexts where it is currently lacking such as beneficial ownership; anti-corruption measures; improving tracking of asset ownership and use of this information including through the establishment of a global asset registry; andCooperation and settling disputes: improving cooperation and standardization on bribery investigation and prosecution; examining options to strengthen peer review processes; exploring options to improve capacity; improving international cooperation on asset recovery and return.Global governance and political economy of reforms are expected to be incorporated into all three clusters.Aiming to identify proposals that are technically feasible, political viable, and have direct bearing on closing the SDG financing gap, the Panel is holding a series of consultations. On 24 April, the Panel consulted with UN Member States, in a meeting of 160 participants including country delegations, the African Group, and the EU. They noted priorities in each cluster (seemeeting summary). The Panel then held a civil society-focused “global town hall,” on 28 April, with over 150 people (seemeeting summary).The FACTI secretariatreportsthat common priorities emerged from both meetings, including: a call for universal participation in robust, effective systems of international cooperation, particularly with respect to tax cooperation and anti-corruption measures; and a call for the Panel to focus on ways to strengthen existing mechanisms, while ensuring that developing countries are afforded equal opportunity to shape the global architecture, in accordance with the principles of the 2030 Agenda.Publiconline consultationsare underway on three topics for experts, academics and practitioners. The consultation on accountability, public reporting, and anti-corruption measures took place on 30 April, followed by the consultation on improving cooperation in tax matters on 5 May.The consultation on cooperation and settling disputes will take place on 8 May. The Panel is alsocalling for public commentsvia email on any of its clusters by 24 May 2020.The Panel planned originally to produce an interim report in July 2020, for presentation during ECOSOC’s High-level Segment that month, and a final report with recommendations February 2021. However, in light of the COVID-19 crisis, the interim report is now scheduled to be completed by September. [FACTI website]
Colombia has adopted a law limiting the use of lead paint, particularly in items used by children. The law cites “the right of persons to develop physically and intellectually in a lead-free environment.”The Lead in Paint Billadoptedon 27 July 2020 prohibits the use, manufacture, import, or marketing of articles that contain lead exceeding 99 ppm (0.009%), especially in elements of direct or frequent contact by children. It also calls for blood tests in children to determine their level of lead exposure, sets out national responsibilities for treating exposure cases.We are responding to a young country that wants to see a more positive evolution in the protection of the environment.According to apress releasefrom the Colombian legislature, President Iván Duque highlighted the importance of the law for protecting children in the country, as well as protecting the environment. He said, “We are responding to a young country that wants to see a more positive evolution in the protection of the environment.”Senator Nadia Blel said the law ensures that “children will be able to live without fear that their toys, colors, the paintings in their houses will become a threat to their health.”Led by Colombia’s Ministry of the Environment, the government will have one year to develop environmental monitoring protocols for industries that include lead and its compounds in their processes.
22 May 2019: The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Brabant Center for Sustainable Development released the ‘SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities.’ The report compares the performance of European capital cities and selected metropolitan areas on the SDGs.According to SDSN, approximately 65% of the SDGs’ 169 targets “will not be reached without proper engagement of, and coordination with, local and regional governments.” In addition, SDSN emphasizes that action at local levels is critical to achieve transformation in energy, transportation and urban planning, as well as in access to health and education, among other areas.The first-ever SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities features 45 European cities and covers 56 indicators. Oslo, Norway placed first, with a score of 74.8, which means that Oslo is 74.8% of the way to realizing the SDGs, based on the measures used in the Index. Stockholm, Sweden placed second with a score of 74.2, followed by Helsinki, Finland (71.3), Copenhagen, Denmark (68.7) and Zurich, Switzerland (67.5). The five lowest-performing cities are Bucharest, Hungary (54.4), Valletta, Malta (53.8), Nicosia, Cyprus (53.7), Porto, Portugal (53.5) and Athens, Greece (48.6).European cities perform better on SDGs 2 and 3 than US cities, due to healthier lifestyles.European cities performed best on SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). In addition, European cities perform better on SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 than US cities, which the report attributes to “healthier lifestyles that help prevent excessive weight gain” and chronic and preventable diseases.Cities in Europe performed the worst on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). Reporting that all European cities perform poorly on SDG 13, the author emphasize the need for further action to achieve zero net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030. The report states that poor performance on SDG 12 is a result of low shares of ground and surface water with good chemical status. Poor performance on SDG 15 is partially explained by a lack of green spaces and high percentage of soil sealing in European cities. In addition, most European cities face challenges in reducing air pollution. Another challenge in most European cities is access to affordable and quality housing (SDG target 11.1).The report highlights challenges in data availability, quality and comparability at the sub-national level. The report states that the European Commission (EC) has defined territorial levels and metropolitan areas and standardized subnational data and indicators, through the EC’s Joint Research Centre and Eurostat, but it stresses that “major gaps remain to monitor all SDGs.” In particular, the report cites challenges in measuring income and wealth inequalities and disparities in access to services, hindering the ability to measure the “leave no one behind” component of the 2030 Agenda.

A side event, held during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, shared lessons learned from implementing the Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) programme in Colombia, Guatemala and Uruguay, and underscored the need to consider the land, agriculture and forestry nexus.The event took place on 5 December, and was titled, ‘Agriculture and Land Use Sectors in Latin American and Caribbean NDCs: Identifying Gaps in Mitigation and Adaptation Policies, and Promoting Participative Solutions.’ It was organized by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).Enzo Benech, Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, Uruguay, said 80% of his country’s income comes from the production and export of food and commodities, noting that any climate impacts on agriculture are felt across the economy. He lamented that Uruguay has been “vilified” due to the cattle per capita ratio, and called for more dialogue to understand differing national priorities.Paula Andrea Zuleta Gil, Director, Financing and Agricultural Risk, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Colombia, described: local, multi-stakeholder technical agroclimatic committees that are addressing emissions from farming; a rigorous process that resulted in consensus recommendations for each crop; and an innovative agriculture insurance scheme for small-scale coffee farmers. She said her country’s NAP-Ag will focus on risk management, sustainable agriculture, agriculture and livestock resilience, low-carbon policies, and institutional integration.Panelists also mentioned,inter alia:a loss and damage component in Uruguay’s NAP and the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation process;an Earth Security Group report, ‘Financing Sustainable Rice for a Secure Future,’ which describes innovative finance partnerships for mitigation and adaptation such as a rice bond, which could help rice processors, traders and retailers provide farmers with capital to transition to sustainable agriculture, improve resilience and boost yields; andintegration of traditional knowledge into implementation of Guatemala’s NAP.The NAP-Ag programme, a multi-year initiative funded by the Government of Germany, supports partner countries to identify and integrate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector into relevant national planning and budgeting processes.

18 June 2019: The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC) has released a report on energy efficiency in G20 economies that presents an update on the G20 Energy Efficiency Leading Programme (EELP) and an overview of technical work undertaken during the year.The report titled, ‘Accelerating Energy Efficiency Progress in G20 Economies,’ was presented during the G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth, which convened from 15-16 June 2019, in Karuizawa, Japan.G20 countries are working together to progress energy transitions that achieve ‘3E+S’: energy security, economic efficiency, and environmental safety. In this context, energy efficiency is critical to the G20’s efforts to facilitate such transitions, including by securing a more sustainable, cost-effective energy future.The report captures progress made on the implementation of the G20 EELP and its initiatives and outlines opportunities for G20 voluntary actions aimed at raising awareness on the importance of innovation, that is “accelerating the virtuous circle of environmental protection and economic growth by innovation.”TheEELPwas launched in 2016 as a platform for energy efficiency and international cooperation, with a focus on buildings, industry, transport, appliances, and cross-sectoral areas such as finance. It is the G20’s first long-term plan for energy efficiency up to 2030, and its implementation helps support and advance the design, acceleration and enactment of national energy efficiency policies and programmes. This led to the endorsement by most G20 members of the 2017 G20 Action Plan on Climate and Energy for Growth, which includes theG20 Energy Efficiency Investment Toolkit.The report details that, over the past five years, G20 EELP initiatives (or Task Groups), coordinated by IPEEC, have focused on: super-efficient equipment and appliances deployment; networked devices; buildings; transport; energy management; finance; energy efficiency best available technologies and best practices; ‘high-efficiency, low-emissions,’ energy end use data and energy efficiency metrics; district energy systems; and theEnergy Efficiency Knowledge Sharing Framework.The report concludes that the G20 EELP Task Groups continue to play a central role in accelerating energy efficiency policies and programmes in G20 economies, by: deepening technical collaboration among G20 economies on implementation of best practices; providing technical assistance for developing policy frameworks and roadmaps; and facilitating ongoing dialogue between governments, industry and other key stakeholders.The report emphasizes the importance of cooperative efforts to reduce energy demand to achieve energy transitions that support ‘3E+S’. It also calls for,inter alia: gathering reliable energy efficiency data; and raising awareness regarding the role of finance and investment in promoting innovation in clean technology and energy efficiency.The report encourages G20 members to advance innovation to implement the economy-wide decarbonization strategies that are needed to deliver optimal net zero pathways and societal benefits of the energy transition, as well as climate objectives and the SDGs.Established in 2009, IPEEC identifies and facilitates implementation of public policies and programmes related to energy efficiency.

UN Member States are beginning negotiations on a declaration for the UN’s 75th anniversary. In a food-for-thought paper, the co-facilitators suggest five possible elements of the declaration, to be discussed during informal consultations on 21 February 2020.Plans to issue a declaration wereagreedin June 2019. The declaration is meant to be “concise, substantive, forward-looking and unifying” and to reflect Member States’ commitment to multilateralism, the UN and “their shared vision for a common future.”On 6 January 2020, the UNGA Presidentannouncedthe appointment of the Permanent Representative of Qatar, Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, and the Permanent Representative of Sweden, Anna-Karin Eneström, as co-facilitators for the intergovernmental negotiations on the declaration to be adopted at the commemoration event, which will convene on 21 September 2020.In a letter of 7 February 2020, the co-facilitators wrote to UN Member States to announce the first informal consultations on the document. They suggest discussion of five possible elements:Acknowledging achievements: What are the UN’s main contributions to its three pillars of work – development, human rights, and peace and security?Looking ahead: What measures are needed over the next 25 years to strengthen multilateralism and reinvigorate global governance?Responding to major global challenges: What are today’s most fundamental global challenges? How is the UN standing up to new challenges?Delivering on commitments: How can the UN better deliver on its purposes and principles?Building consensus and mobilizing for change: How can the Decade of Action advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind? How can the UN maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors? How can the UN strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth?The first informal consultation will convene on 21 February 2020 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The meeting will be open to Member States and permanent observers.The UNGA has agreed that negotiations on the declaration will conclude by June 2020, and the declaration is to be adopted by consensus.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) has released a report that finds the number of young people around the world not in employment, education or training (NEET) (SDG target 8.6.1) has been increasing since 2017. The report states that this SDG target “will be missed,” underscoring the need to increase “efforts to generate decent jobs for the next generation of workers.”The report titled, ‘Global Employment Trends for Youth 2020: Technology and the Future of Jobs,’ highlights that the number of young people classified as NEET has risen from 259 million in 2016 to 267 million in 2019, and is expected to continue increasing to approximately 273 million in 2021. Young women are twice as likely as young men to face precarious employment situations, and two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women. The gender gap is even more pronounced in the Arab States and Southern Asia, where cultural and social norms are more likely to prevent women from pursuing education or working outside the house. Youth unemployment also varies by region, from 30% in Northern Africa to less than 9% in Northern America.Two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women.The report finds that a narrow focus on vocational training, a lack of jobs to match qualifications, and increasing automation are creating a “precarious future in the labor market” for young people. Employees between the ages of 15 and 24 are at greater risk of losing their jobs because of further technological advances than older workers.The report also identifies challenges with vocational training, which tends to impart occupation-specific skills that become obsolete faster than general education skills. As a result, employees with vocational training are even more vulnerable. To address these concerns, the report calls for modernizing vocational training programmes to meet the evolving demands of the digital economy.Young people who complete tertiary education are less likely to lose jobs to automation. However, the increase in the number of young people with degrees has outpaced the demand for graduate labor, resulting in falling returns to tertiary education and pushing down wages for graduates. The report addresses a number of additional challenges, including informal and less secure forms of employment and a digital divide between regions and generations.The report recommends an integrated policy framework to support young people’s ascent into decent jobs and to assure that new technologies positively impact on youth employment. The report argues for policies to generate a sufficient number of decent jobs, to equip young people with the skills needed for those jobs, and ensure social protection for workers.The ILO also produced briefing notes on youth employment trends by region.

The Secretariat of the Strategic Approach for International Chemicals Management (SAICM) has circulated a report from the December 2019 meeting of the High Ambition Alliance on Chemicals and Waste. The report is expected to be considered during the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in October 2020, in Bonn, Germany.The Alliance discussed a possible new framework for chemicals management and linkages with combating climate change.The High Ambition Alliance met in Madrid, Spain, on 9 December 2019, on the sidelines of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 25). According to the meeting report (SAICM / IP.4 / INF / 8), the Alliance called for a high-level declaration at ICCM5 on a strengthened SAICM beyond 2020 with enhanced action by more stakeholders. Alliance members also discussed: interlinkages between sound chemicals and waste management and combating climate change; work towards a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution to adopt a new framework for chemicals management; and linkages with and the need for action in other sectors, including health, labor, and agriculture.The High Ambition Alliance is jointly facilitated by Uruguay and Sweden. It was established in July 2018 to promote dialogue and cooperation to raise awareness, ensure commitments, and promote ambitious, sound chemicals and waste management. Alliance members include: Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Indonesia, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, the US, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), IPEN, the International Council of Chemicals Association, and IKEA.The Alliance’s work supports the ‘Beyond 2020 inter-sessional process’ mandated by ICCM4 in 2015, and the adoption of an ambitious global chemicals and waste agenda at ICCM 5 for the post-2020 period. The intersessional process was scheduled to have itsfourth meetingfrom 23-27 March 2020, in Bucharest, Romania. That meeting has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The next meeting of the Alliance is tentatively scheduled to meet in June 2020 on the margins of the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon, Portugal.

The UN General Assembly has set the stage for the next full review of the UN’s development work, which takes place every four years. The negotiations are expected to place “an unprecedented focus on supporting Member States in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.”Known as the quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR), the process waslast conductedin 2016. Its implementation was assessed during the May 2020 session of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, which also assessed progress in the ongoing reforms to the UN development system. These findings are expected to guide the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in negotiating the 2020 QCPR.UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed – who leads the organization’s work toreposition the UNDS– hasexpressed hopethat the 2020 QCPR could serve as a “a forward-leaning tool that takes the system’s collective accountability for results to the next level.”By the resolutionadoptedon 11 August 2020 (A / RES / 74 / 297), Member States:Take note of the Secretary-General’s report (A / 75 / 79–E / 2020 / 55), which addresses the UN’s support for governments to “recover better from the [COVID-19] crisis and deliver during the decade of action” for the SDGs;Take note of the report of the Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group on the work of the Development Coordination Office (DCO) (E / 2020 / 54), which marks the first annual account of the new resident coordinator (RC) system and DCO operations. The Chair reports that a “truly empowered and independent” RC system was launched on 1 January 2019, and is supported by the stand-alone global DCO;Welcome the progress achieved by the UN development system, take note of the challenges on repositioning it, and look forward to the implementation of all reform mandates;Regarding the UN development system’s “regional assets,” request the UN Secretary-General to continue transparent and inclusive UN consultations on their “longer-term reprofiling and restructuring” to ensure this takes place in accordance with each region’s specific needs and priorities, and stress that regional repositioning should be conducted with the support of the regional economic commissions, specialized agencies, funds, programmes, and regional offices of the DCO; andRegarding multi-country offices (MCOs), welcome recommendations on reinforcing support in MCO settings and call for continued consultations, as part of enabling countries to implement the 2030 Agenda.The UNGA’s negotiations on the QCPR should begin in October 2020.
