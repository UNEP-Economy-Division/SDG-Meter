26 July 2019: The second part of the 25th annual session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which included meetings of the Authority’s Council and Assembly, focused on the Authority’s central consideration at this point in time: the development of the draft exploitation regulations on deep-seabed mining. These regulations, once concluded, will govern future activities in the world’s oceans.The regulations will need to ensure environmental protection while simultaneously balancing stakeholders’ interests.The ISA was established as an autonomous institution under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to organize and control activities in the Area, particularly with a view to administering the resources of the Area. “The Area” is defined as the seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, and its “resources” as all solid, liquid, or gaseous mineral resourcesin situin the Area at or beneath the seabed. Among other things, the ISA is mandated to provide for the necessary measures to ensure the effective protection for the marine environment from harmful effects, which may arise from mining activities in the Area.During its 25th session, the Council delved into the draft exploitation regulations, submitted by the Legal and Technical Commission (LTC), addressing provisions on,inter alia:applications for approval of Plans of Work in the form of contracts;rights and obligations of contractors; andprotection and preservation of the marine environment.The Assembly considered the implementation of the Authority’s Strategic Plan 2019-2023, including adoption of the High-Level Action Plan and the corresponding key performance indicators. The Assembly also adopted criteria and guidelines for applications for observer status in the work of the Authority.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreports that the July 2019 sessions were successful in advancing calls for environmental protection in deep-sea mining, operationalizing the Authority’s Strategic Plan, and shaping the organizational culture towards more participation and transparency. The increasing interest in the Authority’s work is testament to the increasing public awareness in deep-sea mining.Participants also commemorated the 25th anniversary of the ISA with a special session on Thursday, 25 July, attracting national delegations from more than 70 countries. In celebrating the 25th Anniversary, delegates expressed their intention to “ensure a thorough and timely development of the regulations, bearing in mind that necessary standards and guidelines should be developed before their adoption.” In addition, there were reminders through the Council meeting that “the regulations’ development does not take place in a vacuum.” They are influenced by the strategic direction of the Authority, which, for the first time in its history, has begun implementing a Strategic Plan. This Plan, in turn, decides the ISA’s positioning in the global oceanic realm and in environmental governance.The Council met from 15-19 July, and the Assembly from 22-26 July in Kingston, Jamaica. These meetings were preceded by meetings of the LTC (1-12 July) and the Finance Committee (8-10 July).The ISA Assembly and ISA Council will next meet in February 2020.

TheFood Systems Dashboardis an interactive tool that allows users to compare and analyze over 150 indicators of food systems at the country level. It aims to support policymakers, researchers, and civil society to examine variables that determine the availability, value, and health consequences of food resources globally.The Dashboard was developed by the Johns Hopkins University and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), with collaborators at Harvard University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the Agriculture-Nutrition Community of Practice.Data on environmental factors will be added in January 2021.Most of the data in the Dashboard is open source. It is pooled from FAO, Euromonitor International, the World Bank, and other data sources.A “Compare and Analyze” feature allows users to explore indicators organized according to six clusters: food supply chains; food environments; individual factors; consumer behavior; diets and nutrition; and drivers. The Dashboard provides for visualizations and comparisons globally, regionally, and by country, food systems type, or income classification. The Dashboard also includes 41 indicators for each country to provide in-depth insights into the challenges and opportunities facing countries and their food systems.The Food Systems Dashboard aims to provide a complete view of food systems, with indicators related to natural resources, climate, agriculture, policy, commerce, and culture. It shows the types of foods that constitute the average diet, where foods are sold, and the effects of climate change, urbanization, and migration, among other factors.The Dashboard, which was launched in June 2020, is automatically updated as governments release new information. Data on environmental factors, including water quality, land use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is expected to be added to the dashboard in January 2021.

SheTrades has released a guidebook that aims to help female entrepreneurs develop the skills and confidence needed to raise funds to start or grow their own businesses. The guide provides key information, shares tips and recommendations, and incorporates exercises to help users test their knowledge throughout the chapters.The guidebook titled, ‘SheTrades Invest: Raising Funds for Your Business,’ covers nine topics, from understanding financial needs and financial instruments available to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to choosing and preparing to approach the right capital provider. The guide offers a nine-step process for users to calculate their company’s financial needs, and shares a checklist to improve a company’s internal financial management.The guide also focuses on how women can enhance their capacity and skills to confidentially approach investors and raise funds. As a first step, the guide recommends making a list of available capital providers in the country. Second, it recommends finding out the capital providers’ priorities, preferred client profiles, and conditions to determine if the company fits the preferred client profile and can comply with their requirements. Third, the guide suggests preparing for the capital providers’ credit or investment process to be ready to apply for financing. The guide outlines the step of the loan credit process, including application, negotiation, and credit administration. Sections also focus on the “golden rules” of managing the negotiation process with an investor, starting with being clear in one’s own mind about items on which you are prepared to be flexible and which items are final, and on managing an ongoing relationship with investors.ITC is a joint agency of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the UN. ITC developed SheTrades Outlook under the ITC SheTrades Initiative, which aims to connect three million women to international markets by 2021. UKaid supports SheTrades. [Publication:SheTrades Invest: Raising Funds for Your Business] [ITC and SheTrades Publication Landing Page]
28 June 2019: A mapping of SDG coverage by the UN General Assembly (UNGA), UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and other UN bodies and fora in light of the 2030 Agenda has been shared with governments. The co-facilitators of this intergovernmental process also set out possible criteria for reducing overlaps and duplication between intergovernmental UN bodies and forums.Discussions on alignment and coherence between UN organs started in 2016 during the 70th session of the UNGA, and continued during the subsequent UNGA sessions, with the Permanent Representatives of Czech Republic and Timor-Leste facilitating consultations during the 73rd session. On 28 June, the co-facilitators shared a draftnoteoutlining conclusions from preceding informal consultations and expert-level informal-informal consultations held to date.Per the note, delegations have outlined the importance of the “full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda” with a focus on poverty eradication in all its forms and dimensions. They also decided to update themappingof SDGs and targets, which had originally been prepared under the leadership of Colombia during UNGA 70. The initial mapping had shown, among other observations, that the majority of SDGs contain targets either covered in existing UNGA and / or ECOSOC agendas, or that could be covered by making use of existing agenda items. It also found that the targets of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) are “largely uncovered under the UNGA and ECOSOC agendas.”The co-facilitators included the updated and “simplified” version of themappingas an annex to their note, explaining that the newer version looks at how the SDGs, rather than their targets, are addressed by the agendas of various UN bodies. Taking the form of a table, the document includes, for each SDG, relevant information related to the work of the UNGA’s Second Committee (Economic and Financial), Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural), other committees, ECOSOC, and ECOSOC subsidiary bodies. According to the co-facilitators, the mapping does not include the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since it has the mandate to cover all SDGs and to oversee a network of follow-up and review processes at the global level. Neither does it include ECOSOC’s High-level Segment or Integration Segment, which have an annual theme identical to the HLPF’s, and may address issues related to any SDG.The co-facilitators also shared, as a second annex to their note, a document comprising possible criteria for reducing overlaps and duplication. For example, the document states that an overlap or duplication might be justified if an item relates to an issue mandated to be mainstreamed in the work of all UN bodies (such as gender mainstreaming) or the item is a cross-cutting issue (such as financing).Consultations were expected to resume on 3 July.

Researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography have published a study that suggests previous estimates of plastic in the ocean may be “off by five to seven orders of magnitude.” The US National Science Foundation (NSF) provided financial support for the study.The study developed and tested a new method for collecting and counting tiny microplastics in the ocean. They measured mini-microplastics in the guts of salps, a planktonic species that transports carbon and particles from the sea surface to the deep sea. Every salp the researchers examined had ingested plastic.The traditional method for estimating marine microplastics is “likely missing the smallest particles.”The study found much higher concentrations of tiny microplastics in the ocean and suggests that the traditional method for estimating marine microplastics is “likely missing the smallest particles.” The study estimates the ocean contains 8.3 million pieces of mini-microplastics per cubic meter of water. Nearshore samples had higher plastic concentrations than samples from the open ocean.Despite significant interest in microplastics, “we are just beginning to understand the scale and effects of these ocean contaminants” NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences program director, Dan Thornhill, observed. He said the study “demonstrates that marine plastics are far more abundant than anyone realized and can be found potentially everywhere in the ocean,” resulting in consequences for the environment and human health.[News Story] [Publication:Patterns of suspended and salp‐ingested microplastic debris in the North Pacific investigated with epifluorescence microscopy]
11 July 2019: Looking ahead to the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) review of the functions of the HLPF, as well as the five-year milestone of SDG implementation, an event organized on the sidelines of HLPF 2019 shared civil society perspectives on how to organize the upcoming review and improve stakeholder engagement in the process.The event highlighted the outcomes of surveys carried out at the national, regional and global levels, and presented recommendations included in the Principles Paper for HLPF review developed by civil society networks, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that the HLPF fulfils its mandates of tracking progress, providing political guidance, and identifying gaps on achieving the SDGs.Recognizing the impact of the HLPF on regional and national implementation, the civil society initiative aimed to gather diverse voices to maximize the opportunity presented by the review process to improve global-level follow up and review mechanisms. During a panel discussion, speakers called for, among other issues: more ambition of the HLPF based on lessons learned; more time for presentation and discussion of Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) during the HLPF; a stronger focus on leaving no one behind; and better alignment and integration with other frameworks beyond the 2030 Agenda.Discussing some priorities for the next review cycle, participants agreed that the HLPF should focus on the principle of leaving no one behind and enhanced civil society engagement, at early stages of political discussions. The discussion also stressed the need for more solidarity and recognition of the role of local and national governments as vital elements for a successful 2030 Agenda.The event was co-organized by Together 2030, Action for Sustainable Development, the Transparency, Accountability, and Participation (TAP) Network, and Forus.

G20 countries have committed at least USD 382.29 billion to supporting various energy sources through new or amended policies since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a tracking platform launched in July 2020.While at least 35% of public money has been committed to clean energy, at least 52% of public money committed to the energy sector has been committed to fossil fuels.As of 26 August 2020,energypolicytracker.orgreports that public money commitments for clean energy include at least USD 50.19 billion for unconditional clean energy through 72 policies, and at least USD 88.59 billion for conditional clean energy through 50 policies. However, public money has also been committed to fossil fuels: commitments include at least USD 177.73 billion for unconditional fossil fuels through 151 policies and at least USD 26.27 billion for conditional fossil fuels through 21 policies.The Energy Policy Tracker database was developed by 14 expert organizations. Itshowcasespublicly available information on public money commitments for different energy types, and policies supporting energy production and consumption. The platform isupdatedevery Wednesday with research that collects data on individual policies at an individual country level and aggregates them. Updates can be received by signing uphere.Policies are classified according to: energy type; whether it has any environmental conditionality attached; the economic sector being targeted by the policy; and the mechanism for transfer. The tracker currently includes only G20 countries and EU policies (defined as European institutions by the tracker).The organizations behind the research include the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Oil Change International (OCI), Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Columbia University in New York City, Forum Ökologisch-Soziale Marktwirtschaft (FÖS), Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN), Instituto de Estudos Socioeconômicos (INESC), Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE), Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), Legambiente, REN21, and The Australia Institute (TAI).
In their latest report on trade developments in the region, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) highlight that non-tariff measures (NTMs) play an increasingly important role in regulating trade, and can help achieve the SDGs. NTMs include measures such as quotas, phytosanitary measures and environmental standards.The biannualreporttitled, ‘Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2019: Navigating Non-Tariff Measures Toward Sustainable Development,’ maps existing NTMs in Asia-Pacific against each SDG, finding that many NTMs relate to health (SDG 3) and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), while other aspects of sustainable development are neglected. For example, very few NTMs in the region address illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing (covered by SDG 14) and illegal timber trade (part of SDG 15).The authors note that some NTMs are thought to have indirect or unintended benefits for sustainable development. For example, NTMs imposing restrictions on the sale of alcohol may have positive impacts on gender equality (SDG 5) by reducing violence against women (SDG target 5.2).Asia-Pacific countries have increased their use of NTMs have by 15% each year, as developing countries “catch up” to apply standards that are already prevalent in more developed economies. However, many countries lack the necessary infrastructure, such as testing laboratories, to assess conformity with regulations. The authors recommend building capacity and expertise in developing countries to strengthen local capacity and promote developing countries’  participation in international standard setting, to ensure that international standards benefit them and are relevant to their needs.They further recommend that countries conduct detailed sustainability impact assessments on the impacts of NTMs at the country and sector levels, and propose developing regional guidelines on sustainability impact assessment of NTMs.While NTMs increase the costs of trade, the report emphasizes that NTMs “are neither good nor bad,” and sets out good practices in applying NTMs. [Publication:Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2019: Navigating Non-Tariff Measures Toward Sustainable Development] [Report conclusions]
17 July 2019: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), one of the member institutions of the World Bank, has launched a five-year Global Sustainable Development Bond in support of the Sustainable Development Goals on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and life below water (SDG 14). With BMO Capital Markets, RBC Capital Markets, and TD Securities as joint lead managers, the bond raised CAD 1.5 billion from institutional investors and will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.The Sustainable Development Bond was issued as part of a World Bank initiative to engage investors on the SDGs. The final order book was oversubscribed, with final books in excess of CAD 1.85 billion. According to the World Bank, “the high quality, diversified order book was reflected in the allocation to 47 investors globally.”On the occasion of the bond launch, the World Bank, the largest multilateral funder for ocean and water projects in developing countries, expressed its commitment to work with countries to ensure access to safe and clean water and for the sustainable use of ocean and marine resources. The instrument’s joint lead managers highlighted that the bond’s success showed how well its thematic focus on the ocean and water resonated with Canadian investors. [World Bank Press Release]
An issue brief from IDDRI (Sustainable Development and International Relations) suggests avenues for more efficient financing processes for the 2030 Agenda, particularly in the context of the vulnerabilities highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis. It argues that the “true test” of 2030 Agenda financing is not how much is invested in projects on one or more of the 169 SDG targets, but whether projects are designed to minimize the negative externalities and maximize the positive externalities across multiple Goals and targets.Authors Maria Alejandra Riaño and Damien Barchiche explain that synergies among SDGs and their targets “do not occur automatically.” As shown by the ongoing pandemic, one missing element such as efficient governance, health system, energy provision, or management of natural resources—can have effects throughout the economy and society.This is related to the growing risk of “SDG-washing,” the authors suggest. Understanding the actual impact of investment flows is particularly important during a crisis. They report that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on several initiatives to help map financing flows to the SDGs and assess remaining needs and gaps.With regard to country-level financing, the brief recommends developing Integrated National Financing Frameworks, as agreed by UN Member States in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development. The Frameworks would spell out financing and implementation plans for the national sustainable development strategy, thus providing investors with clarity and predictability “across the three time horizons of relief, recovery and long-term structural transformation.”The issue brief titled, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: prerequisites, and opportunities for the post-Covid-19 crisis,’ sayseffectively implementing and financing the 2030 Agenda requires “forceful” alliances and partnerships that are grounded in local and national needs and capabilities, invest heavily upfront, invest in innovation and use science-based solutions, and have the support and participation of government authorities. [Publication:Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Prerequisites, and Opportunities for the Post-Covid-19 Crisis]
16 September 2019: The chair of the UNGA’s economic and financial committee has briefed delegates on plans for the 74th session. He emphasized the need to discuss new economic models, pursue innovative economic thinking, and provide guidance as governments implement the 2030 Agenda.The Chair of the UNGA’s Second Committee for the 74th session is Cheikh Niang, Permanent Representative of Senegal. Saying the Committee will be guided by the 2030 Agenda, Niang announced that the session’s theme will be: ‘Inclusive societies based on new economic models and sustainable use of natural resources.’ He noted his interest in focusing on innovation and “new thinking” on economic issues, and he said the Committee’s deliberations could “provide crucial guidance and inspire focused action” as Member States pursue implementation of the 2030 Agenda.The provisional programme of work and timetable for the session are available at theCommittee webpage. Per the documents, the Committee will begin its substantive work on 7 October 2019. The two keynote addresses that will open the session are expected to highlight, respectively, the double bind of income poverty and time poverty, and emerging economic models and economic transformation. The Committee then will conduct a general debate before taking up its 12 agenda items for the session. A joint meeting will be convened with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on “ecosystem approaches for shifting the world onto a sustainable pathway.”Niang outlined the items on the Committee’s agenda, as well as special events, milestones and topics that discussions are expected to address. These include:On small island developing States (SIDS), the monitoring and review framework for the SAMOA Pathway, which will be discussed at a high-level meeting of the UNGA on 27 September 2019;On climate, ways to build on the Climate Action Summit taking place on 23 September 2019;On landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), accounting for the upcoming midterm review of the Vienna Programme of Action in December 2019;On biological diversity, dealing with the SDG and Aichi targets that have a 2020 deadline;Plans to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary in 2020;On the least developed countries (LDCs), giving early guidance to the Fifth LDC Conference in 2021; andOn UN system operational activities, following up on the funding compact, and giving guidance for the next QCPR, including on regional and multi-country office reviews.The briefing took place on 16 September 2019, in New York, US.

26 June 2019: The Government of Japan has become the 12th country to submit its long-term strategy (LTS) for low-emission development to the UNFCCC Secretariat, which covers the period 2018-2050. Japan’s Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) highlights the country’s intent to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050, while realizing “a virtuous cycle of environment and growth” with business-led disruptive innovation, rapid implementation of actions, and efforts from other countries.The LTS describes the country’s long-term vision for the energy, industry and transport sectors, as well as for community and living, and the direction of related policies and measures.On energy, the LTS mentions options related to energy efficiency, renewable energy, storage batteries, hydrogen, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU).On industry, the Strategy describes Japan’s intent to establish new production processes to achieve decarbonized manufacturing with disruptive innovation through the use of carbon dioxide (CO2)-free hydrogen, feedstock change, and improved energy efficiency, development and introduction of low-global warming potential (GWP) and non-fluorocarbon refrigerant technologies.Japan’s LTS describes efforts to achieve the world’s highest level of environmental performance of Japanese cars for worldwide consumption by 2050.Regarding transport, the LTS describes efforts to achieve the “world’s highest level of environmental performance” of Japanese cars for worldwide consumption by 2050 through enhanced international policy coordination on electric vehicles. It also describes,inter alia, local decarbonization, achieving the SDGs and carbon-neutral living by 2050.The LTS discusses the promotion of innovation for practical application and use of cross-sectoral decarbonizing technologies. It details a Progressive Environment Innovation Strategy, which includes technical assessment based on cost required by users and emission reductions, and accelerating public research and development. The LTS also addresses cross-sectoral policy measures, including: human resources development; enhancement of an integrated approach in building a resilient society; a just transition; government efforts to decarbonize; and carbon pricing.Japan will aim for stronger business initiatives, as well as target setting and visualizing issues for commercialization in the fields of energy efficiency and transformation, CCUS, hydrogen, renewable energy and nuclear. The LTS also highlights promotion of green finance and initiatives to expand environmental, social and governance (ESG) finance.Japan will also support decarbonization at the global level, including by helping partner countries formulate their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).The policy measures detailed in the strategy will be reviewed approximately every six years, and implementation will consider input of all stakeholders, including younger generations.The LEDS was developed under the guidance of the Ministry of Economy, with support from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). Japan joins Benin, Canada, the Czech Republic,Fiji,France,Germany, theMarshall Islands,Mexico,the US,the UKand Ukraine who have already submitted their LTSs. [Japan’s LEDS] [UNFCCC LEDS Website]
The 52nd session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-52) concluded with agreement on the outline for the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report.The outline, which was discussed throughout the week-long meeting and was the subject of contact group discussions on the penultimate evening and last day of IPCC-52, contains a stage-setting introduction and three sections: Current Status and Trends; Long-term Climate and Development Futures; and Near-term Responses in a Changing Climate. TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreportfrom the meeting indicates that “some of the more contentious issues that came up during the discussions on the outline related to the carbon budget, timeframes, just transition, and extreme events and loss and damage, among others.”In addition, delegates at the meeting, which took place from 24-28 February 2020, in Paris, France, discussed the organization of future work of the IPCC in light of the Global Stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement, on which views diverged over a range of options regarding possible alignment of IPCC and GST cycles. Some questioned the need for discussing an alignment at this point, while others suggested other ways of promoting timely inputs to the GST.The Panel also adopted the IPCC Gender Policy and Implementation Plan, which establishes a Gender Action Team to oversee and monitor implementation of the Plan and develop and implement a protocol and process for addressing complaints. The Panel considered reviewing the Principles Governing IPCC Work, and whether to establish a task team to consider which elements might need reviewing, but participants did not agree on a review process, and the Panel will consider recommendations forwarded by the Bureau at IPCC-53.In closing remarks, IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee thanked delegates for their work and efforts, which “paid respect to the spirit of cooperation and upheld the integrity of the IPCC and objectivity of its assessment activities.” [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of IPCC-52]
15 June 2019: The 13th Annual Meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Creative Cities Network (UCCN) brought together UCCN mayors under the theme, ‘The Ideal City.’ Mayors renewed their commitment to building on the impact of culture, creativity, cooperation and innovation to foster sustainable cities and communities in line with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).Conclusions from the meeting, which convened in Fabriano, Italy, from 10-15 June 2019, underscore the UCCN’s mission to build on culture and creativity for sustainable development, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UCCN mayors recommend the development of a long-term strategy for the Network’s governance and sustainability that should focus on “demonstrating and measuring impact and achievements for sustainable development at the local, national and international levels in the spirit of” the 2030 Agenda.Creative Cities are emerging as hubs of experimentation that lead to innovative and successful models of sustainable development.At the gathering, the mayors stressed the cross-cutting contribution of culture to achieving the SDGs. They shared examples of how their cities are addressing community needs by building on culture and creativity to develop innovative and inclusive urban strategies, and explored the role of culture across development areas such as education, inclusiveness, environment and economic growth.The meeting also shared the first publication of the UCCN LAB.2030 Initiative titled, ‘Voices of the City: UNESCO Creative Cities Moving Towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ which discusses the diverse ways in which the Creative Cities embrace culture in their local policies to achieve the 2030 Agenda.According to a UCCN press release, “Creative Cities are emerging as hubs of experimentation that lead to innovative and successful models of sustainable development.” Cities of Literature, for example, aim to ensure freedom of expression and literacy for all, while fostering multilingual environments, in line with SDG 4 (quality education). Cities of Gastronomy are promoting SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). Cities of Film and of Music provide spaces for promoting human rights, equality and solidarity, contributing to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 10 (reduced inequalities) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). Cities of Design seek to reinvent housing, public spaces, access and mobility and to stimulate social innovation and global citizenship, helping achieve SDGs 4 and 11. Cities of Crafts and Folk Art and Cities of Media Arts enhance the diversity of cultural expressions and safeguard community practices, and promote contemporary urban narratives and space for cultural expression with new technologies, respectively.Launched in 2004, the UCCN comprises 180 cities from five continents, and focuses on seven creative fields: crafts and folk arts; design; film; gastronomy; literature; media arts; and music. The next UCCN annual meeting will convene in 2020 in Santos, Brazil.

Equitable access to water and sanitation is still a challenge for Europe, according to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO)-UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). Thirty-one million people in Europe do not have access to basic sanitation, 48 million people do not have piped water at home, and more than 300,000 people still practice open defecation, mainly in the countryside. The JMP is reporting its findings in the lead-up to the 10th anniversary of the Protocol on Water and Health, an international instrument supported by UNECE and WHO-Europe.UN agencies launched the report titled ‘The Human Rights to Water and Sanitation in Practice: Findings and lessons learned from the work on equitable access to water and sanitation under the Protocol on Water and Health in the pan-European region’ at the 5th session of the Meeting of the Parties (MOP-5) to the Protocol. The findings were generated through self-assessment by 11 countries that UNECE and WHO-Europe support to implement the Protocol: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, North Macedonia, Moldova, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Ukraine. The report notes that the Protocol acts as a mechanism for implementing the SDGs, particularly SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, and countries have been involved in developing and applying guidance and tools to support equitable access to water and sanitation.There is “a long way to go” on action to improve equitable access to water and sanitation.Some of the findings reported by countries in their self-assessment include a lack of human rights awareness among public officials, discrimination against Roma minorities, and lack of facilities for menstrual hygiene at public venues. UNECEnotedthere is “a long way to go” on action to improve equitable access to water and sanitation, which would promote achievement of SDG targets 6.1 on clean water and 6.2 on sanitation.Countries have taken concrete measures to achieve the Protocol, for example:Hungary amended its National Building Code to reflect minimum requirements and standards for access to water and sanitation in buildings;France and Portugal included provisions to ensure affordability of water and sanitation services in law or policy;North Macedonia is improving menstrual hygiene facilities in cafes, bars and restaurants in the city Skopje; andthe city of Castelló in Spain has installed seven new public drinking water fountains.To promote equitable access, the report recommends that countries: reduce geographical differences in the services provided; prevent discrimination or exclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups in the provision of services; and ensure financial affordability of services.
11 October 2019: A coalition of academic scientists, citizen scientists and UN Environment Programme (UNEP) experts authored an article that highlights the untapped potential of citizens to play a role in monitoring the SDGs, particularly the environment-related indicators. The article published inNaturepresents a roadmap for integrating citizen science data in the SDGs.The article titled, ‘Citizen science and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,’ highlights that traditional data sources “are not sufficient” for measuring the SDGs, and new and non-traditional data sources will be required.UNEP statistician and a co-author of the study, Jillian Campbell, said “we have insufficient data for tracking global progress for 68% of the environment-related SDG indicators.” Campbell stressed the world “will never be able to monitor” the environmental dimensions of the SDGs using traditional data sources alone. Within this context, UNEP and others are highlighting the potential of data generated by citizens and their organizations, or “citizen science,” in helping to monitor the SDGs.Citizen-science data is already being used in support of SDG indicators. The article shares several examples of non-traditional data sources that contribute information relevant for SDG monitoring, from official sensor networks for monitoring weather, air pollution and traffic, to commercial data sets maintained by telecommunication and utility companies.The authors address concerns regarding the quality of citizen-science data, sharing citations that show that citizens can “make valuable and scientifically valid contributions that are on par with professional scientists.” For example, the Mosquito Alert citizen-science initiative has demonstrated that its data collection can be “quicker and cheaper” and obtained with “the same level of accuracy of traditional methods.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List Index is another example. The authors share measures to evaluate the quality of citizen science, and highlight the development of approaches to handle data quality concerns.The article provides a roadmap for integrating citizen science into formal SDG reporting mechanisms at global and national levels. At the global level, citizen science can help identify candidate indicators for the global SDG indicator framework, identify relevant citizen-science projects and develop protocols to ensure data quality. At the national level, citizen science can: mobilize and integrate citizen science stakeholders and communities; map existing citizen science contributions to SDG indicators; promote dialogue on data quality, metadata, standards and interoperability; create an inventory of examples and good practice; build on existing policy frameworks that advocate citizen science for decision-making; and integrate citizen science data streams into practices of countries’ National Statistical Offices (NSOs). One existing example is the EU-funded WeObserve project that maps contributions from citizen science to SDG indicators.The article concludes that success in integrating citizen science into SDG monitoring will require leadership from the UN, innovation from NSOs and focus from the citizen-science community.

24 September 2019: The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has issued the results of a study on costing and financing the SDGs in the world’s 59 low-income developing countries. It highlights a SDG financing gap of USD400 billion per year for these countries, and notes that LIDC governments will require a substantial increase in fiscal revenues far beyond what they can achieve through their own fiscal reforms.The SDSN paper,issuedon 23 September 2019, was prepared by theSDSN Costing and Financing Teamwith inputs from the Working Group on SDG Costing and Financing (SDG Costing Group). The SDG Costing Group is convened by SDSN and co-chaired with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).The paper points to the importance of international cooperation to enable the LIDCs to meet the Goals. It outlines measures to help fill their financing gap including:mobilizing private investments in blended financing (USD50 billion);mobilizing increased revenues earmarked for SDG-related expenditures by closing international tax loopholes (USD50 billion);introducing globally harmonized taxes, such as wealth taxes for ultra-high net worth individuals (USD100 billion), financial transactions taxes (USD50 billion), and carbon taxes (USD50 billion);increasing and better targeting official development assistance (USD100 billion); andexpanding private philanthropy through the GivingPledge(USD30 billion).The paper further proposes a policy roadmap for 2020. The roadmap calls for,inter alia: a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution asking UN Member States to undertake the actions needed to close the SDG financing gap; multilateral agencies such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the UN to prioritize the mobilization of additional SDG financing; supporting country-level SDG planning, budgeting and implementation; multilateral international institutions, member countries and other relevant officials and stakeholders to focus on compiling more accurate fiscal profiles of countries and assessments to meet the SDGs; and expanding the role of global funds, while ensuring that global funds are well-resourced and well-designed.Per the paper, the ad hoc SDG Costing Group seeks to build a community of practice that can support country-level and global SDG costing and financial planning. The group – composed of approximately 60 members from various organizations – also works to mobilize best costing practices and costing tools to support lower-income countries with the preparation of budgetary frameworks, revenue strategies and development assistance strategies to achieve the SDGs. The findings of the group are expected to facilitate the work of national governments, among other actors, and inform the UNGA on matters related to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development (FfD). It should further inform the OECD-Development Assistance Committee (DAC) on its advice to donor governments on supporting the SDGs.The paper’s conclusions were presented during aneventon ‘The Cost of Success: Identifying SDG Financing Needs and Pathways for Low-Income Countries’ that took place on 24 September 2019, at the Permanent Mission of Denmark, during the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) high-level week.

The Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) released an updated version of its SDG-Human Rights Data Explore, which allows users to explore the links between human rights and the SDGs. The update expands the database to illustrate how anti-corruption and responsible tax practices can contribute to the SDGs.DIHR released anexperimental versionof the ‘Sustainable Development through Human Rights Due Diligence Database’ database in April 2018 and anupdated versionin January 2019. The database aims to promote a more coherent, systematic framework for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as to facilitate its follow-up and review. The database uses an algorithm to automatically identify links between the SDG targets and over 150,000 recommendations and observations from international human rights mechanisms, including the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), UN Treaty Bodies and the Special Procedures under the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).The database now includes ‘tax, anti-corruption and human rights’ as a human rights issue. The database notes that the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have identified corruption and tax crime as “key obstacles to sustainable economic, political and social development, particularly in developing and emerging economies.” They note that bribery, corruption and tax evasion increase inequality and reduce efficiency. Further, tax is a key tool for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to protect, promote and fulfill human rights and implement the SDGs.Case briefs highlight examples of corporate leaders pushing for transparency tax systems and multi-stakeholder group efforts to end corruption. Other cases share how an energy company has called on its peers to demand increased tax transparency, and how a telecommunications company has published country-by-country tax information. Each case highlights the connections between tax, anti-corruption and human rights with relevant SDG targets, including several targets from SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre published a handbook to support local-level authorities in preparing reviews of SDG implementation (“voluntary local reviews,” or VLRs). The handbook provides examples from 14 reviews presented since 2018.Beginning in 2016, national governments have been invited to prepare Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of their national planning to implement the SDGs, as part of the global follow-up and review mechanism for the 2030 Agenda. The VNRs are presented during the UN’s annual sessions of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). In 2018,municipalities began preparingtheir own SDG implementation plans and reports, termed VLRs.The ‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’releasedin early 2020, provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation. The indicators can help local-level authorities establish baselines for their communities, compare action with that of other cities, and monitor their progress on addressed specific challenges.The scope of each VLR varies. For example:Helsinki, Finland’s VLR is structured around five goals using a limited number of local indicators with an in-depth analysis of the different challenges;Bristol, UK’s VLR is based on the UN’s guidelines for VNRs, and reviews each of the 17 Goals;Kitakyushu and Shimokawa, Japan also review each of the 17 Goals;New York City, US has focused annual VLRs on the selected SDGs under review by the HLPF each year; andLa Paz, Bolivia includes includes maps of the indicators per city district.The report suggests the following steps be taken to localize the SDGs in a particular community:define the management method;conduct a mapping exercise of the SDGs versus the existing city strategic plan development;define the number and type of Goals the city wants to assess and monitor;diagnosis the state of the SDGs in the community through the preparation of a VLR;conduct co-creation sessions with stakeholders and communities;define an agenda and targets, redefine monitoring indicators, and adapt management mechanisms;conduct pilot projects;monitor the projects; andevaluate the projects and redefine priority actions.The JRC intends to test the data and methods presented the Handbook with selected cities, and will update and improve the methodology for local SDG monitoring.The JRC is the science and knowledge service of the European Commission.

Transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to account for 5.3% of all anthropogenic emissions by 2030, up from 5% in 2016, according to a report published by the International Transport Forum (ITF) and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Therefore, UNWTO calls for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to transform tourism for climate action.The report titled, ‘Transport-related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector: Modelling Results,’ also notes that while the number of tourists is increasing, the sector is progressing towards low-carbon travel, and emissions per passenger kilometer are expected to decrease over the next decade.The report provides insights into the evolution of tourism demand across the different global regions up to 2030, and details emissions produced by different modes of tourism transport. With growing international and domestic tourism, the data are presented alongside the expected transport-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the tourism sector against the current ambition scenario for the decarbonization of transport.During the report’s launch, UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler urged tourism policymakers to use the data effectively and ensure that the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate crisis. Ovais Sarmad, UNFCCC Deputy Executive Secretary, said that while many Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) cite tourism as a concern, industry must do more, and governments must align their policies, so that at the international level, we can collectively work to increase ambition. He cited theOne Planet Sustainable Tourism Programmeas a critical mechanism to promote sustainable tourism.The report also finds that that: transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to increase by 25% from 2016 to 2030; tourism-related transport emissions will be approximately 21% of all transport emissions in 2030; and international and domestic arrivals are expected to increase from 20 billion in 2016 to 37 billion in 2030, which, in addition to an increase in emissions, will lead to socioeconomic development and job creation.The report also recommends that the tourism sector determine its own high-ambition scenario to complement the efforts of the transport sector. For example, tourism could advance towards decoupling growth from emissions.The report was launched during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain.

The EU and China discussed the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery, trade, climate change and the SDGs, bilateral relations, and other regional and international issues during the 22nd bilateral summit. The summit took place via videoconference on 22 June 2020.On economics and trade, the EU “recalled the joint commitment to work constructively and expeditiously towards the resolution of a number of market access and regulatory issues.” Noting “an unbalanced trade and investment relationship” between the EU and China, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, called for addressing market access barriers and more ambition from China to conclude negotiations on an investment agreement. Von der Leyen also urged China “to engage seriously” on a reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO), in particular on the future negotiations on industrial subsidies.On climate change, the EU urged China to live up to its commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change, and called for China to commit to ambitious domestic action to reduce emissions in the short term, including by addressing decarbonization in China’s next five-year plan. The EU further urged China to commit to climate neutrality “as soon as possible after 2050.” The EU also called on China to support sustainable development, especially in Africa.European Council President, Charles Michel, said the EU and China must work together on climate action, achieving the SDGs, and addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. He emphasized that engaging and cooperating with China “is both an opportunity and necessity,” and said the EU must recognize that “we do not share the same values, political systems, or approach to multilateralism.” Von der Leyen, said relations between the EU and China “must become more rules-based and reciprocal” to achieve a level playing field.Chinese President Xi Jinping identified three areas of work to ensure that China and the EU are: “two major forces for world peace and stability”; “two major markets for world development and prosperity”; and “two major civilizations for upholding multilateralism and improving global governance.”On the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU and China agreed on the importance of supporting vulnerable countries and populations, including through the Global Response Initiative. The EU called on China to participate in the World Health Assembly-mandated review of lessons learned on the international health response to COVID-19. The EU highlighted a shared responsibility to participate in global efforts to stop the virus’s spread, increase research on treatments and vaccines, and support a green and inclusive recovery.The EU emphasized the importance of results-oriented implementation of commitments made at the 2019 EU-China Summit. The EU stressed a need to advance negotiations on an EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement that ensures a “level playing field” and addresses “current asymmetries in market access,” including progress on technology transfer and transparent subsidies. The EU emphasized that data protection and respect of fundamental rights are critical in development of new technologies.Leaders discussed a number of other issues, including Hong Kong, human rights, and regional and international conflicts.

10 July 2019: Despite technological and operational improvements planned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the international aviation sector, which contributes to 1.3% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is not on track to meet its emissions reduction targets. The proposed Recarbonization of Global Soils (RECSOIL) Facility aims to curb aviation sector CO2 emissions by supporting farming practices that boost soil organic carbon (SOC) for climate change mitigation and adaptation.According to analysis by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), agricultural and degraded soils have the potential to sequester more than 60 times the emissions generated by the aviation sector in 2018. With an estimated 33% of global soils characterized as degraded, “recarbonization” offers a solution for offsetting the projected rise of emissions in the international aviation industry, thus contributing to achievement of multiple SDG targets, including enhanced agricultural productivity and income for farmers (SDG target 2.3), food security and nutrition (SDG 2), and climate change resilience (SDG target 13.1).RECSOIL will provide incentives and technical training to encourage farmers to adopt effective soil organic carbon-centered practices.Presenting the rationale as well as operationalization modalities for the mechanism, the FAO publication titled, ‘Recarbonization of Global Soils: A Dynamic Response to Offset Global Emissions,’ explains that the aim is to scale up SOC-centered practices, while fostering other co-benefits of sustainable soil management. In particular, RECSOIL will seek to prevent further SOC losses from carbon-rich soils such as peatlands, black soils and permafrost and, where feasible, for example in agricultural and degraded soils, to increase SOC stocks. The facility also aims to contribute to the growth of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the aviation sector.RECSOIL will support activities at two broad levels. At the global level, the Facility will support the development of a SOC monitoring system linking national, regional and global reporting, including on progress in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the UNFCCC. On the ground, the facility will provide incentives and technical training to encourage farmers to adopt effective SOC-centered practices.The proposed RECSOIL facility is coordinated by the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) as part of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The Global Risks Report 2020 has been published in advance of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). According to a press release by the WEF, “for the first time in the survey’s 10-year outlook, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood are all environmental.”The Global Risks Report informs the WEF’s multi-stakeholder initiatives throughout the year.The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.The report frames the global economy asfacingincreased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.TheWorld Economic Forumwill convene from 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland under the theme, ‘A Cohesive and Sustainable World.’ The meeting aims to “shape global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.” The Four global issues that will feature prominently on the agenda include environmental challenges, sustainable business; technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and demographic, social and technological trends reshaping education, employment and entrepreneurship.

5 July 2019: The 41st meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (OEWG 41) laid the groundwork for decisions to be taken at the 31st Meeting of the Parties (MOP 31), which will convene in November 2019.Over 450 participants from governments, UN agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, academia, and industry attended OEWG 41, which convened in Bangkok, Thailand, from 1-5 July 2019.In her opening statement to OEWG, Tina Birmpili, Executive Secretary, Ozone Secretariat, highlighted the need for continued national vigilance and enforcement and for improving global monitoring. Agenda items that were discussed and kept open for MOP 31’s further consideration included:unexpected emissions of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11);terms of reference (ToR) for the study on the 2021-2023 replenishment of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol;review of the ToR, composition, balance, fields of expertise and workload of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP); andToR for the 2022 Quadrennial Assessment.Agenda items whose discussions were concluded at OEWG 41 and noted in the meeting report include: risk of non-compliance with hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) production and consumption reduction targets by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; and safety standards.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinanalysis looks at the Montreal Protocol’s more than 30-year history of surmounting challenges, including those related to an “old” or “settled” subject such as CFC-11, by channeling the guiding principles and practices of the Montreal Protocol: trust in science; trust among Parties; and trust in the Protocol itself. It highlights that “a number of Parties lamented that an inordinate amount of time has been occupied at OEWG 41, and will be required at MOP 31, to continue to address the illegal usage of CFC-11.” It notes that the commitment to support other Parties exemplifies the trust that Parties have historically had in each other and the continued desire to preserve this trust.

18 July 2019: The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conducted a global survey of countries to identify existing laws on the right to information, and how they are observed. The researchers found that 125 countries have enacted right to information laws (RTI) or similar provisions.UNESCOlaunchedthe report titled, ‘Powering Sustainable Development with Access to Information: Highlights from the 2019 UNESCO Monitoring and Reporting of SDG Indicator 16.10.2,’ during the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in New York.Guy Berger, UNESCO, cited a recommendation from the study that governments better oversee the implementation of RTI laws. He said they could do so by connecting oversight bodies such as Information Commissions with national-level SDG monitoring bodies. The publication notes that, while national regulation systems increasingly support freedom of information, oversight and appeals bodies and individual public authorities could do “far better” in tracking and processing information requests and appeals.The survey data contributes to global monitoring of SDG target 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements. In the UN system, UNESCO is the custodian agency for SDG indicator 16.10.2 on the number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional statutory and / or policy guarantees for public access to information. Its work on monitoring and reporting of access to information is conducted through itsInternational Programme for the Development of Communication, supported by Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

15 July 2019: With one month to go before the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, which is expected to catalyze climate action and ramp up ambition, the SDG Knowledge Hub looks at the status of ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. Since our last ratification update on 20 November 2018, eight countries have ratified the Amendment.The Doha Amendment establishes the Kyoto Protocol’s second commitment period from 2013-2020. It was adopted by Decision 1 / CMP.8 at the eighth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 8), in Doha, Qatar, in 2012.Since November 2018, eight Parties have ratified the Amendment, bringing the total number of ratifications to 130. Dominica submitted its instrument of acceptance on 15 July 2019; Kuwait on 8 May 2019; Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) on 23 April 2019; Lesotho on 18 January 2019; Mongolia on 20 February 2019; Montenegro on 26 December 2018; Nicaragua on 3 July 2019; and Paraguay on 21 February 2019.The Amendment will enter into force when 144 Parties, or three-quarters of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, have submitted their instruments of acceptance to the Depositary. It is now 14 ratifications away from entry into force.

As we mark World Toilet Day and there is more and more discussion about the importance of dealing with human waste, many people will become embarrassed or shocked, and some would rather avoid the subject altogether.However, the sanitation crisis that exists in many parts of the world, and the impact it has on nature, cannot be ignored.A recentUN progress reportshows that with just 12 years until the deadline, we are seriously off track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of sanitation for all by 2030: Today 4.5 billion people live without safely managed sanitation, and 892 million people going to the toilet in the open.[1]Human waste, on a massive scale, is not being captured or treated properly, turning the environment into an open sewer.In streets and fields around people’s homes, human excreta is spreading deadly diseases by contaminating water resources and farmland that communities rely on to survive.So, we must not only build more toilets for those who remain unserved. We must also build more toilets that work in harmony with ecosystems.Nature-based sanitation solutions harness the power of nature to help treat human waste before it returns to the environment.Most nature-based sanitation solutions essentially involve the protection and management of vegetation, soils and wetlands, including rivers and lakes. For instance, composting latrines capture and treat human waste on site, producing a free supply of fertiliser to help grow crops. And human-made wetlands and reed-beds filter contaminants out of wastewater before it is released back into water courses.Technologies like these, that expand coverage of sanitation services at the same time as protecting nature, must be a bigger part of the mix as we work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of toilets for all by 2030.The UN-led campaign ahead of World Toilet Day is titled, ‘When nature calls’; a play on words with a serious meaning. Nature is sending us a message that we must listen to and act upon urgently.Our ecosystems cannot absorb an ever-growing volume of raw faeces. And billions of people cannot cope with the ill-health and indignity caused by ineffective or non-existent sanitation.The sanitation crisis, if allowed to continue, will undermine the overarching ambition of the 2030 agenda: to build safer, more resilient societies on a healthy planet.With just 12 years to go to the 2030 deadline, for the sake of people and the planet, we must redouble our efforts to provide universal access to toilets, leaving no-one behind.By Rolf Luyendijk, Executive Director, UN-hosted Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC), on behalf of the UN-Water 2018 World Toilet Day Task Force[1]WHO / UNICEF (2017):Progress on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene: 2017 update and SDG baselines.
UN Member States have set a theme for the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The same theme applies to the 2019-2020 cycle of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).By the agreement reached on 14 November 2019, the theme will be, ‘Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ The UN General Assembly (UNGA) is expected to meet soon to formally adopt the decision.Craig John Hawke, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, served as facilitator for the process to identify the theme. He began the consultation process by proposing as a a theme, ‘Transformative pathways to realize the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development,’ and anon-paperoutlined the rationale. Member States discussed the proposal in an informal consultation on 5 November.The theme aims to reflect the need for accelerated action, and to be easily communicable.On 12 November, Hawkewroteto delegations noting that the proposed theme had received broad support, but discussions had also emphasized the need for the theme to be “easily communicable” and to “reflect the need for accelerated action.” The final draft theme aimed to incorporate these views and was proposed for agreement via silence procedure. The reference to “transformative pathways” is expected to enable discussions to “build on the Global Sustainable Development Report” (GSDR 2019). The GSDR titled, ‘The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development,’ was authored by anindependent group of scientistsandreleasedin September 2019 as an input to thefirst SDG Summit.On 14 November 2019 UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bandeannouncedthat the silence had been unbroken. He intends to convene a plenary meeting of the UNGA to adopt the theme.In addition to the HLPF, the theme will apply to ECOSOC’sother segmentsin the 2019-2020 cycle.The HLPF convenes every year under the auspices of ECOSOC, and once every four years at summit-level, under the UNGA’s auspices. The2020 HLPFwill take place from 7-16 July, in New York, US. It will include the presentation of voluntary national reviews by50 UN Member States, as well as thematic discussions. Additional details of the 2020 session have not yet been determined; the UNGA is mandated to conduct an intergovernmental review of the HLPF’s functioning in early 2020.
The Alliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA) and Wetlands International have provided a preview of their upcoming report on the role of peatlands and wetlands in limiting the impacts of climate change and promoting the well-being of people and nature. The agencies call for investing in wetlands to maintain or restore ecosystem resilience, and for introducing relevant wetland indicators into monitoring systems associated with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, SDGs and Paris Agreement.In their policy brief titled, ‘Valuing Wetlands: An Untapped Resource for Achieving a 1.5 Degree Future’, the agencies note that degradation and loss of natural wetlands is “accelerating at an alarming pace.” They present seven recommendations for improving the management of wetlands around the world. They include assessing the mitigation potential of specific wetlands using the national greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), prioritizing biodiversity conservation and sustainable land use, and directing financial investments toward nature-based solutions.“The degradation and loss of natural wetlands is accelerating at an alarming pace.”The report is one of four AGWA policy reportsreleasedon the occasion of the UNFCCC conference in Madrid, Spain. AGWA is a multi-stakeholder network for promoting sustainable water management. The network includes development banks, government agencies, businesses, civil society and academia.
The UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Government of Singapore and partners launched a global technology and innovation initiative for sustainable agriculture titled ‘Cultiv@te.’ The initiative, which aims to transform agricultural practices in light of increasing strains from climate change and pressures on food supplies, was announced on 12 November at the Singapore FinTech Festival.Cultiv@te will curate multi-stakeholder coalitions to tackle major challenges faced by developing countries and explore opportunities in urban agriculture, climate resilience and livestock farming.Through the programme, mature growth-stage startups and research and development teams from academic institutions, together with local innovators, technology experts, corporate mentors, and financiers, will co-design solutions with farmers and policy makers in a number of emerging markets that have large potential and needs. Applications are open viawww.cultivate.technology.Hazri Hassan, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore, explained that the government decided to launch this initiative together with UNDP as Singapore currently imports more than 90% of its food, which makes it vulnerable to disruptions in the global food supply. To address this, the government has set a target to locally produce 30% of Singapore’s foodstuff needs by 2030. To do so, it will transform its agri-food sector to raise productivity, invest in innovation and adopt sustainable technologies.Edwin Chow, Enterprise Singapore, added that open innovation is becoming “increasingly important” in driving the development of tech solutions that are both novel and practical in addressing real-world problems. He said Cultiv@te will help companies and governments to access a wider pool of solution providers, while allowing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startups to validate the market need for their new and existing technology.Bradley Busetto, UNDP, highlighted the importance of having globally-sourced technologies and innovations combine in new ways with market insights, know-how and traditional farming practices to positively impact sustainability and livelihoods of farming communities.

8 August 2019: As of 8 August 2019, 47 countries have announced their intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Of the 47 countries, 24 will present their VNRs for the first time, while 23 countries will present a second or third VNR.The 24 first-time presenters will include: Austria, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Gambia, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Moldova, the Russian Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.The 23 countries planning to present for a second or third time are: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Jordan, Monaco, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.Fifteen of these countries hadannouncedtheir intention in February 2019. As noted in our SDG Knowledge Hub report at that time, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development specifies, in paragraph 79, that Member States should “conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels, which are country-led and country-driven.” These reviews are supposed to draw on contributions from Indigenous peoples, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, “in line with national circumstances, policies and priorities.” National parliaments and other institutions “can also support these processes.”The 2030 Agenda also indicates, in paragraph 84, that when the HLPF is meeting under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), it shall carry out regular reviews that are voluntary and state-led, involving ministerial and other relevant high-level participants, and involve developed and developing countries. The reviews are also to “provide a platform for partnerships, including through the participation of major groups and other relevant stakeholders.” [UN VNR Database]
25 September 2019: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued a report discussing ways public governance can strengthen SDG implementation, based on experiences, good practices and lessons learned from countries around the world. Among other purposes, the publication supports a new initiative from the OECD and the UN Development Programme on governance of the SDGs.The publication titled, ‘Governance as an SDG Accelerator: Country Experiences and Tools,’ includes sections on: whole-of-government and policy coherence; stakeholder participation and open government; effective use of budgeting and public procurement tools; monitoring, evaluation and audit insitutions; fostering a culture of integrity and fighting corruption; and governance frameworks to ensure equal access to justice and citizens’ legal empowerment, and to support gender equality. Each chapter is accompanied by case studies.The VNRs show a lack of reflection and understanding about including evaluation in national follow-up and review processes.The report was published on 16 July 2019 to coincide with the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). It is meant as a “live repository” of experiences, good practices and lessons learned from countries’ governance challenges related to the SDGs.The report finds that none of the countries reviewed has fully integrated their SDGs into its budgeting exercise, but case studies from Egypt, Paraguay and Slovakia show how results-based resource allocations can help strengthen accountability mechanisms. As mentioned in thisbrochureon the publication, setting high-level goals and indicators is a first step for the effective use of budgeting tools, and needs to be followed by a national strategy plan, overall reporting and accountability system.On monitoring, evaluation and audit institutions, the report indicates that while most countries reviewed have established a monitoring framework for SDG implementation, only a few have addressed the question of how to evaluate SDG achievements. It further notes that a review of 43 Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) refers to “a general lack of reflection and understanding about how evaluation should be included into the SDGs’ national follow-up and review processes.”Among the case studies included in the report, Indonesia, Lithuania, Thailand and the UK illustrate the relevance of tackling corruption to achieve sustainable development and the importance of promoting integrity through a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. Australia, Canada and the UK provide insights on how to assess legal needs and facilitate access to justice to vulnerable groups, like indigenous communities, women, and socially and economically disadvantaged people through a comprehensive approach. Iceland, Kazakhstan, Lithuania and Mexico case studies include examples of gender mainstreaming practices to position gender equality at the core of national development goals.The publication provides empirical evidence to the Global Hub for the Governance of the SDGs, which was launched on 25 September 2019. The Global Hub is a joint initiative of OECD and UNDP, and seeks to facilitate targeted support to interested countries on specific SDG-related governance challenges.

The EU and 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries stressed the need to enhance climate ambition ahead of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC in Glasgow, UK, in 2020, and highlighted the economic and societal opportunities arising from the transitioning to low-emission and climate-resilient economies.Meeting at an event during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, they called for countries to engage in long-term planning to help translate increased ambition into concrete policy measures.Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President, European Commission, expressed hope that the European Green Deal can inspire others. ACP Secretary-General Patrick Gomes called for strengthening the global response to climate change in the context of sustainable development. Krista Mikkonen, Environment and Climate Change Minister, Finland, called for a “coherent and clear vision” towards achieving climate neutrality by 2050.From 2014 to 2018, EU funding for cooperation with the ACP Group of States on climate change totaled EUR 1.7 billion, which included strengthening the resilience and adaptation capacity of ACP countries through the Intra-ACP Global Climate Change Alliance Plus, a joint EU-ACP initiative worth EUR 70 million. ACP-EU cooperation also includes the EUR 85 million Climate Services Programme to strengthen capacities of regional hydrometeorological organizations to access and use climate information and services for policy decision making, and a EUR 100 million disaster risk reduction (DRR) programme to be launched in 2020 as a follow-up to an ongoing EUR 180 million programme. [ACP Press Release][EU Press Release]
The 32nd UN-Water Meeting reviewed a draft UN-Water 2030 Strategy and forwarded input to the negotiation process under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to develop a post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Meeting participants also discussed a proposed SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) Global Acceleration Framework in the context of the UN Secretary-General’s recent call for a Decade of Action to deliver the 2030 Agenda.The SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework is expected to include a commitment platform for the acceleration of the Decade of Action, strengthened cross-sectoral approaches using the six entry points for transformative action identified in the Global Sustainable Development Report 2019, and better coordination and delivery at the country level. Participants at the 32nd UN-Water Meeting decided to commit to develop the Framework with the aim of launching it at the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in July 2020.In addition, plans to engage at the country and regional levels were discussed in light of ongoing UN reforms, and participants were briefed on the upcoming launch of the CEO Water Mandate’s Water Resilience Pledge / Coalition.Participants alsodiscussedthe roadmap for upcoming UN high-level meetings on water and sanitation that will take place in 2021 and 2023. They highlighted opportunities to use a variety of forums, summits and other meetings taking place in the lead up to these events to shape a cohesive and comprehensive strategy to address important SDG 6 issues, both effectively and efficiently. Discussants also highlighted UN-Water’s Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 and efforts to update monitoring and reporting in the lead up to these high-level meetings.The 32nd UN-Water Meeting took place in Rome, Italy, from 28-29 January 2020. UN-Water Meetings bring Members and Partners together twice a year to carry out the mandate of informing policies, monitoring and reporting, and inspiring action on water and sanitation issues. The 33rd UN-Water meeting will convene in August 2020 in Stockholm, Sweden, immediately prior to 2020 World Water Week.

June 2019: A report by the Circle Economy, a membership-based organization, has provided a range of recommendations for municipalities to promote the transition from a linear to a circular economy. The report, based on research in several European cities, argues that municipalities and governments are responsible for creating conditions for the circular economy to thrive, and suggests that such a transition could create 700,000 new jobs in the EU by the year 2020.The report titled, ‘The Role of Municipal Policy in the Circular Economy: Investment, Jobs and Social Capital in Circular Cities’, presents the findings of a study by Circle Economy and the Erasmus Happiness Economics Research Organisation, supported by the Goldschmeding Foundation. In the 34-page report, the authors propose that governments adopt strategies and targets to help the business community share societal and environmental objectives, provide loans and subsidies for circular economy activities, and promote networks and information sharing. The report includes examples of local government action on circular economy in European cities, including Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam, and Birmingham. It also highlights the work of companies engaged in circular economy activities, including sustainable transport and logistics, and avoidance of food waste.The concept of a circular economy was highlighted during the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) as a way of achieving SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production as well as other Goals. An October 2018 joint meeting of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s Economic and Financial Committee (the Second Committee) and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on Circular Economy for the SDGsnotedthat the concept has particular application to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).Circle Economydescribesits mission as accelerating the transition to circularity through the development of practical and scalable solutions and international campaigns. Its membership is made up of businesses and institutions that share this aim, including Oxfam. The Amsterdam-based organization has programmes on cities, jobs, textiles, the built environment, finance, and “remanufacturing.” [Publication:The Role of Municipal Policy in the Circular Economy: Investment, Jobs and Social Capital in Circular Cities]
With reports of new record high temperatures, summer in the Northern hemisphere has yet again reminded us of the urgency of climate response. People are returning from vacations to a packed September agenda, with SDG 13 (climate action) occupying a prominent place in the beginning of the 73rd UNGA session.Anadditional negotiating sessionto facilitate the timely completion of the Paris Agreement work programme (PAWP) at the24th sessionof the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC will convene in Bangkok, Thailand, at the beginning of the month. The conference is expected to advance discussions on mitigation and adaptation aspects of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), transparency of action and support, the global stocktake (GST), the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, and other issues. A set of seven “tools” issued by the Co-Chairs of theAd HocWorking Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) ahead of the session will aid negotiations.TheGlobal Climate Action Summit, convened by Governor Jerry Brown and the State of California in San Francisco, US, will continue to build momentum towards COP 24 in December. The high-level event will be facilitated by Governor Brown, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action Michael Bloomberg, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, Mahindra Group Chair Anand Mahindra, Xie Zhenhua, Special Representative for Climate Change Affairs, China, and Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth. By providing a platform for state and local governments, business representatives and civil society to showcase climate actions at all levels, the Summit is expected to inspire deeper commitments and accelerated action to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.Coming on the heels of the Summit isClimate Week NYC 2018, which will bring together multiple stakeholders for a series of panel discussions, concerts, exhibitions and seminars that will seek to catalyze further climate action by addressing issues related to climate policy, investments and finance, future energy, the SDGs, science, clean transport, sustainable food and travel, and retail. TheOne Planet Summitand theBloomberg Global Business Forumwill contribute to building trust and collaboration for multilateral climate action and sustainable development.Taking place alongside Climate Week NYC isGlobal Goals Week 2018, which seeks to drive progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving the SDGs. The two global Weeks take place during the opening of the73rd sessionof the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73), which will hold its general debate on the theme ‘Making the United Nations Relevant to All People: Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities for Peaceful, Equitable and Sustainable Societies,’ beginning on 25 September.

During a four-day virtual meeting, the Chemical Review Committee (CRC) of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade finalized its work on two industrial chemicals. The CRC agreed to recommend that the Conference of the Parties (COP) make both chemicals subject to the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure.The PIC Procedure is a mechanism for obtaining and disseminating importing parties’ decisions on whether they wish to receive future shipments of certain chemicals, and for ensuring compliance with these decisions by exporting parties. If the COP agrees to the recommendation of the CRC, importers will be notified prior to trade in the industrial chemicals decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts and PFOA-related compounds.As reported by theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, decaBDE is used as a flame retardant in a wide variety of products, including electronic equipment, textiles, mattresses, vehicles, and construction materials. It has been found to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic to humans and wildlife, and it can be released into the environment during production, use, and disposal of items containing it. PFOA and its related compounds are used in products such as non-stick cookware, stain-resistant carpets, and fabrics.During itsvirtual meeting, from 8-11 September 2020, the Chemical Review Committee focused on time-sensitive technical work that had been initiated at its 2019 meeting. In addition to discussions on listing the two industrial chemicals, participants also discussed updates to the Handbook of Working Procedures and Policy Guidance for the CRC and considered how to enhance effective participation by members.The next meeting of the CRC is expected to consider at least eight chemicals.

14 June 2019: The British Columbia Council for International Cooperation (BCCIC) has launched a ‘Movement Map,’ which displays 11,651 civil society organizations (CSOs) in Canada working to support SDG implementation. The map seeks to illustrate the scale and scope of SDG activities.The Movement Map aims to encourage collaboration among organizations already working on the SDGs, and to raise awareness of ongoing efforts. Users can search the map by location, SDG or organization name.In its next phase, BCCIC anticipates organizing roundtable meetings in Canadian provinces and territories to identify organizations that are not yet on the map. BCCIC expects this phase to help advance momentum to achieve the SDGs in Canada. Future phases will also map social enterprises and for-profit groups that contribute to the SDGs. [Movement Map]
The illegal trade of chemicals is the subject of a report from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), which highlights knowledge gaps and enforcement challenges related to the regulating trade in toxic, hazardous, and severely restricted chemicals.The report titled, ‘The Illegal Trade in Chemicals,’ was released on 1 April 2020. In discussing the governance and markets of the illegal chemicals and waste trade, the authors review enforcement failures and best practices, and provide recommendations for policymakers, as well as for communities and users of chemicals.According to the publication, multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) regulate only a fraction of the chemicals being traded, amid exemptions under MEAs and inconsistencies among domestic regulations. The authors report that many toxic products are easily accessible in the marketplace or online, and a lack of reporting mechanisms means that information on illegal trade is scarce and hinders the ability of authorities to act.The report provides a particular focus on the illegal trade of pesticides and mercury, both of which are subject to strong international regulations. However, the scale of illegal trade in these chemicals is unknown, and users of the substances are often unaware of the risks they pose. The authors suggest that public-private partnerships can help raise awareness among vendors, local farmers, rural communities, and private landowners about the health and environmental risks associated with pesticides. They also find that:annual revenue losses of €1.3 billion in the legitimate pesticides industry in the EU are attributable to counterfeit pesticides;an estimated 30% of pesticides sold in developing countries are sub-standard;half of all mercury used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is traded illegally; andthe value of illegally-traded mercury is USD 100–215 million annually.Legitimate businesses, national economies, and human health and the environment are bearing the brunt of the illegal chemicals trade, write the authors. They recommend: building expertise and capacity to identify illegal shipments; establishing national reporting mechanisms to assess illegal trade within national jurisdictions; better controlling the production and marketing of gold and the harmonization of gold-export regimes to reduce the drivers of illicit cross-border trade; and standardized regional mercury-specific trade frameworks and anti-corruption campaigns at the local and national levels.A challenge to reducing illegal chemicals trade is that law enforcement officers are not adequately trained or equipped to detect and recognize illicit chemicals and counterfeit containers. Shipping documents may not report mercury concealed among other materials, or mercury may be delivered in secret to a small port by fishing boat.The report recommendsthat policymakers work to ensure the availability of human and technical resources to combat illegal trade, including to maintain staffing levels and train law enforcement officers to identify and interdict illicit movements of hazardous chemicals, and developing intelligence systems for sharing information among agencies and the coordinating transnational enforcement operations.The report was prepared by UNEP andGRID-Arendalin partnership with the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), the Center for Environmental Law (CIEL), INTERPOL and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), among others.

3 September 2019: President Emmanuel Macron of France has signed a letter of intent committing US$65 million dollars to support forest conservation and conserve peatlands in the Republic of the Congo. The commitment is part of the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), of which France holds the Presidency for in 2019.According to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP), the Republic of the Congo’s forests cover 23.9 million hectares. The country’s peatlands, which were discovered in 2017, can play a critically important role in addressing climate change and maintaining biodiversity. The Republic of Congo’s vision is to maintain a low deforestation rate while diversifying its economy. In 2018, a ministerial decree restricted agro-industrial exploitation to savannah areas, as part of the country’s broader efforts to promote sustainable forest and peatland management and to contribute towards sustainable development and efforts to combat climate change.The letter of intent establishes a long-term partnership to implement the Investment Plan of the Republic of Congo’s national REDD+ Strategy under CAFI. The agreement identifies an opportunity to address biodiversity loss and climate change and work towards the achievement of the SDGs, including SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), through strengthened international cooperation on conserving the Republic of Congo’s forests. Under the agreement, the Republic of Congo commits to avoid conversion of over 20,000 hectares of forest annually and to implement measures to improve forest governance, including tackling illegal logging. The agreement will also support the protection of peatlands by prohibiting their drainage and drying.France, Norway and the European Union (EU) will contribute US$45 million to the agreement. In addition, the French Development Agency (AFD), the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the German Federal Ministry of the Environment (BMU) will contribute US$45 million.This Letter of Intent with the Republic of Congo is the third signed between CAFI and its partner countries. CAFI signed a Letter of Intent with the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 and with Gabon in 2017. CAFI supports national investment frameworks based on Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) and focuses on six high forest cover countries in the Central Africa Region. The UNDP Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office (MPTF) manages CAFI, with UN agencies, the World Bank and other development partners acting as implementing agencies to support the partner countries.

India and South Africa circulated a communication to members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) General Council, arguing that the WTO moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions has “catastrophic” impacts on developing countries’ economic growth, jobs, and the attainment of the SDGs. In another communication, a group of WTO members highlighted “the overall benefits” of duty-free electronic transmissions.The WTO e-commerce moratorium, which bans countries from imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions, dates back to 1998 when ministers at the Second Ministerial Conference adopted theDeclaration on Global Electronic Commerce, calling for the establishment of a work programme on e-commerce, which was adopted later that year. Since then, at every Ministerial Conference, WTO membershave agreed“to maintain the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions.”The WTOWork Programme on Electronic Commercedefines “electronic commerce” as the “production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.” According to arecent WTO report, the enforcement of social distancing, lockdowns, and other measures to address the COVID‑19 pandemic resulted in anuptake in e-commerce, including online sales and streaming of videos and films.In March 2020,India and South Africacirculated a communication, outlining the implications the moratorium has on developing countries, including: tariff revenue losses; impacts on industrialization; impacts on the use of digital technologies like 3D printing in manufacturing; as well as losses of other duties and charges. The countries argue that the moratorium is “equivalent to developing countries giving the digitally advanced countries duty-free access to [their] markets.”According to a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)article, in 2017 alone, the potential tariff revenue loss to developing countries due to the moratorium wasUSD 10 billion. The article further notes that removal of the moratorium could provide policy space for developing countries to regulate imports of electronic transmissions and generate annual tariff revenue of up to 40 times greater than that in developed countries.Acommunicationfrom Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, China, Iceland, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, and Uruguay, circulated in June 2020, highlights apaperby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) titled, ‘Electronic Transmissions and International Trade: Shedding New Light on the Moratorium Debate.’ The members state that, according to the paper, “the overall benefits” of duty-free electronic transmissions “outweigh the potential forgone government revenues” due to the moratorium. The members recommend that these findings be considered in the current discussions on the extension of the moratorium.A decision on whether or not the moratorium should continue will be taken at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12). Originally scheduled for June 2020, the Conference has been tentatively postponed until June 2021.
27 August 2019: UN-Water launched the SDG 6 Data Portal at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden. The website provides ‘snapshots’ of global, regional, and national performance on SDG 6 indicators, as well as data visualizations and animations showing changes that have occurred over time. Besides bringing together existing information on achievements towards SDG 6, the site offers key statistics on economic, social and environmental conditions.TheSDG 6 Data Portalbrings together information from UN agencies that have a formal role in compiling country data on the SDG 6 indicators. The site not only tracks progress towards SDG 6, it also aims to raise awareness of water and sanitation issues, spark action, and improve SDG 6 monitoring and reporting at all levels.The data portal is intended to work as a companion website to the existing UN-WaterSDG 6 monitoring website, which provides information on principles and good practices in SDG 6 monitoring, and offers space for sharing of country experiences. It also complements the existingGlobal SDG Indicators Databasethat is managed by the UN Statistics Division.The site has been developed through theSDG 6 Integrated Monitoring Initiative, supported by Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, and is a flagship product of the Initiative.

May 2019: Participants from multi-stakeholder bodies and initiatives, CSOs and networks, the business sector, academia, regional and local levels, and parliaments gathered for the second meeting of the Open SDGclub.Berlin at the invitation of the German Council for Sustainable Development (RNE). Participants exchanged solutions-oriented ideas, discussed what is being done at the local, national, regional and global levels to implement the SDGs, and highlighted challenges and discussed ways to deal with them.The event took place from 7-9 May 2019, in Berlin, Germany, and brought together 60 sustainability practitioners from over 30 countries.Among other agenda items, participants met with the Advisory Committee on Sustainable Development of the German Bundestag to discuss the role of parliaments in implementing the 2030 Agenda. German sustainability actors joined the meeting on the final day to exchange information about their experiences with SDG-related initiatives. The meeting concluded with a discussion with representatives from the two German ministries responsible for SDG implementation: the Federal Ministry for the Environment and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation.During the meeting, participants met in four teams to discuss challenges and opportunities related to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), multi-stakeholder bodies and processes, subnational implementation of SDGs, and initiatives and projects. Recommendations from each of the teams were shared with the full group, and included:stakeholders should be involved in deliberations on issues that concern those stakeholders, such as the development of HLPF Guidelines for Partnerships;the search for partners and building of alliances across stakeholders requires the use of a common language;data is fundamental for initiating projects;links between the SDGs and existing best practices should be identified;before being presented to HLPF, Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) should be presented to the relevant national government; andthere should be a focus on regular and transparent VNR follow-ups at the national level.Participants discussed and agreed, in their personal capacities, on a Call for Action that:calls for all Heads of State to raise the level of awareness of and commitment to implementing and following up the 2030 Agenda;calls for all parties to use the UN HLPF as the one relevant global mechanism for coordinating and monitoring the 2030 Agenda; andencourages all stakeholders to advance the multi-stakeholder and multi-level approaches to the 2030 Agenda, respecting the needs of future generations.[Open SDGclub.Berlin Call for Action] [SDG Knowledge Hub summary of first Open SDGclub.Berlin meeting][SDG Knowledge Hub sources]
In the paper titled, ‘How to Halt the Global Decline of Lands,’ the lead authors of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ‘Assessment of Land Degradation and Restoration’ present five systemic policy barriers to land restoration and propose 10 solutions for overcoming them.Thepaperpublished inNature Sustainability(10 February 2020) notes that “Land degradation has negatively affected the living conditions of at least two-fifths of the people on Earth and it is estimated to be reducing global economic output by a tenth.” It also highlights the links between land degradation, climate change and biodiversity loss, and notes that land degradation is both avoidable and often reversible.Land degradation is estimated to be reducing global economic output by a tenth.The paper outlines five reasons for the systemic failure to protect lands. It highlights a lack of urgency in addressing land degradation, especially by those benefiting from its exploitation. Secondly, it notes that there is “little agreement on standardized ways of measuring land degradation,” and thirdly, notes that policymakers and consumers are often disconnected by space and time from the impacts on land of their decision making on land resources. Fourth, the paper underscores the multiplicity of forces affecting land health as well as the difficulty of teasing them apart. These include,inter alia, natural, cultural, demographic, economic, educational, technological and political forces. And finally, the paper calls out the impacts of limited institutional capacity and motivation to take action to address land degradation.The publication then presents 10 solutions to overcoming these five drivers of land degradation, especially given the context of the upcoming UN Decade on Land Restoration, set to commence in 2021. Solutions include:Recognizing that the benefits generated by healthy and productive land are a global good;Setting clear, quantifiable, legally binding and ambitious targets;Regularly collecting and evaluating information on the state of the land;Promoting local action to tackle land degradation based on local contexts and needs;Building on all pertinent knowledge sources, and not exclusively on conventional science;Taking into account all the substantive costs and benefits when making decisions that impact land;Reducing human demands for services delivered by land to match the capacity of the land to supply those services sustainably;Encouraging responsible trade and consumption;Strengthening judicial institutions for environmental action by citizens; andProviding a foundation for more sustainable relationships between people and land.The publication calls on public and private sector decision makers, scientists and citizens to each play their role in protecting and restoring land.

The Alliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) have published a background paper on managing the water-related impacts of climate change. It argues that water is key to effective climate change adaptation.The 42-page report titled, ‘Adaptation’s Thirst: Accelerating the Convergence of Water and Climate Action,’ outlines the anticipated impacts of climate change on water,  including floods, drought, tropical storms, decline in water quantity and quality, and changes to fundamental hydrology. The authors call for climate-resilient water management to be ‘the common ground and a unifying agenda’ for adaptation.They provide six detailed recommendations, namely:system-wide action rather than fragmented, infrastructure-focused decision making – for example, multi-level governance and self-organization at lower levels of administration is encouraged;preparations for greater uncertainty in climate conditions, including greater variability in water resources;investments in adaptation, taking full account of likely future water risks;investments in water and climate information systems;aligning water finance with climate finance; andusing water as an enabler of adaptation, ensuring policy coherence.The publication maps out high-level actions that should be taken by water and climate policy and management communities. Its ‘Action Framework on Climate-Resilient Water Management’ cites promising examples from many countries in terms of governance and participation; information and learning; diversity and connectivity; and infrastructure, technology and water management options.The background paper was commissioned by the Global Commission on Adaptation, which seeks to promote concrete solutions to adaptation needs. The Commission is co-managed by the Global Center on Adaptation and the World Resources Institute (WRI). The report is one offour AGWA policy reportsreleased on the occasion of the UNFCCC conference in Madrid, Spain.

Participants at a side event held during the the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, discussed Africa’s development in light of potential asset stranding, and the need for African governments to implement effective natural resource planning to achieve low-carbon economies.The event titled, ‘Africa’s Development in the Age of Stranded Assets: Managing Risks and Seizing Opportunities,’ defined such assets as “those that have become devalued or that countries are unable to monetize due to policy changes, disruptive innovation and / or social and environmental conditions.”Facilitator Youba Sokona, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Vice-Chair, explained that the IPCCSpecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C(SR15) indicates that limiting warming has co-benefits for achieving the SDGs and, noting that socioeconomic development and environmental concerns are “at odds” in Africa, stressed the need for political will to reduce emissions.Africa must address the level of exposure to carbon market risk, burden sharing and knowledge management to ensure more efficient and effective resource use.Fatima Denton, Director, UN University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (UNU-INRA), introduced the discussion paper on ‘Africa’s Development in the Age of Stranded Assets,’ which highlights associated risks of stranding and impacts on mineral-rich countries in Africa, as well as opportunities related to green transitions and economic diversification. She said Africa must address the level of exposure to carbon market risk, burden sharing and knowledge management to ensure more efficient and effective resource use.Jame Murombedzi, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), emphasized that the relationship between production and exploitation of Africa’s resources is historically linked to external interests, including debt, and that Africa’s ability to disinvest in carbon is related to its ability to pay off its debt.Selam Kidane Abebe, Legal Advisor, African Group of Negotiators, highlighted risks in the region, including: legal risks due to commitments to treaties; social risks attributed to job losses that would result from decarbonization; and economic risks due to carbon-related foreign direct investment in Africa.Other issues considered by panelists and participants include:stranded assets representing a double burden on countries through revenue losses and decreased economic growth;the need to direct benefits of resource exploitation to local communities;positive unintended consequences of stranded assets, including a decrease in illicit financial flows;legal, economic and social implications of an energy transition, given countries’ contractual obligations to private fossil fuel companies; andfuture fossil fuel discoveries and risks associated with extraction in a 2°C world.The event, which took place on 3 December, was organized by UNU-INRA.

7 September 2019: Sand and Dust Storms Day at the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14) saw the launch of an international coalition for action on sand and dust storms (SDS). Among other activities, the coalition will develop an SDS source base map with the goal of improving monitoring and response to these storms.According to an UNCCD press release on the Day, “China called for robust international collaboration, especially developing joint standards on SDS intensity and undertaking large-scale interventions. India, the host country of the UNCCD COP14, presented its plan to develop SDS guidance for its states, while Iran reminded the participants that the rich body of traditional and modern knowledge on SDS hot spots could help create a stronger knowledge base [for] regional initiatives.”SDS affect approximately 77% of UNCCD country Parties, or approximately 151 countries. Of these, 45 are classified as SDS source areas. To mitigate this phenomena, which have various health, economic, and environmental impacts, the UNCCD supports a three-pillar approach that focuses on (1) early warning systems; (2) preparedness and resilience; and (3) anthropogenic source mitigation. Within this framework, the Convention supports joint research and monitoring, capacity building, policy development, disaster planning, and sustainable land management measures, in addition to other actions.A guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub titled, ‘Dust Disregards Political Boundaries’discusses how momentum to address SDS has been growing. In December 2017, for instance, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address SDS.Coalition members include: UN Environment Programme (UNEP), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), World Health Organization (WHO), UN Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).UNCCD COP 14 is convening in Delhi, India from 2-14 September 2019.

The year 2020 was supposed to conclude with the adoption of a new ten-year set of global goals and targets to reverse the negative trend of biodiversity loss. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several negotiation sessions and the meeting during which the post-2020 global biodiversity framework was expected to be adopted – the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) – have been postponed until 2021. A key event on the 2020 agenda remains on the sustainable development calendar, albeit in a virtual format: the UN Summit on Biodiversity.To prepare for this meeting, share information with CBD Parties, and reinvigorate the global discussion on biodiversity issues, the CBD Secretariat organized a series of online sessions from 15-18 September 2020. The sessions were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the 24th meeting of the CBD’s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) and third meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI).The fifth edition of theGlobal Biodiversity Outlookwas launched on the first day of the virtual sessions. This flagship report provided a final report card on progress against the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by CBD Parties in 2010 and meant to be achieved by 2020. The report examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health. The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” to:enhance conservation and restoration of ecosystems;mitigate climate change;take action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation;move towards more sustainable production of goods and services; andreduce consumption and waste.On the second and third days, five countries presented reports on their implementation efforts, in an exercise to test a process for conducting party-led reviews of implementation of the Convention and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. This test was organized to support the effort to develop an enhanced review mechanism in the context of COP 15 and the post-2020 biodiversity framework.Also on the third day, participants discussed a report from the Expert Panel on Resource Mobilization, which has identified challenges, including the presence of subsidies that are harmful to biodiversity, a lack of mainstreaming, a failure to address the private sector and other financial mechanisms, and a lack of priority for biodiversity outside environment ministries.On the final day, the Co-Chairs of the Open-ended Working Group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, Basile van Havre and Francis Ogwal, provided an update on the zero draft of the framework. The Co-Chairs reported that the draft includes a new goal on means of implementation, milestones to ensure progress, and a deadline of 2030 for each target, among other changes. A target on the recovery and conservation of wild flora and fauna was added as well.TheUN Summit on Biodiversityis taking place as part of the opening weeks of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 75), with a high-level dialogue on the the theme, ‘Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development’.

The flagship publication of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) reports progress on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health.The CBD Secretariatlaunchedthefifth Global Biodiversity Outlook(GBO-5) on 15 September 2020, during the first of four days of ‘Special Virtual Sessions’ taking place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition to the eight transition areas, GBO-5 reviews progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 10) in October 2010, and were set for the 2011-2020 period. GBO-5 draws on indicators, research studies, and assessments, including the IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as national reports submitted to the CBD.Conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions, among other areas of progress reported in GBO-5.The report highlights ten areas in which progress can be viewed:almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems;the rate of deforestation has fallen globally by about one-third compared to the previous decade;where good fisheries management policies have been introduced, the abundance of marine fish stocks has been maintained or rebuilt;an increasing number of successful cases of eradication of invasive alien species from islands has been reported;a significant expansion of protected area has been reported;conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions;the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization has come into force and is fully operational in at least 87 countries and internationally;national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) have been updated in line with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 by 170 countries (85% of CBD Parties);there has been an increase in the available data and information on biodiversity; andfinancial resources available for biodiversity through international flows have doubled.The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” that draws on efforts related to: enhanced conservation and restoration of ecosystems; climate change mitigation; action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation; more sustainable production of goods and services; and reduced consumption and waste.Also highlighted during the launch event was the second edition of theLocal Biodiversity Outlooks(LBO-2). LBO-2 focuses on local biodiversity and stories of resilience among indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs). It proposes six transition areas aligned with GBO-5:Cultural transitions towards diverse ways of knowing and being;Land transitions towards securing customary land tenure of IPLCs;Governance transitions towards inclusive decision-making and self-determined development;Incentives and financial transitions towards rewarding effective culturebased solutions;Economic transitions towards sustainable use and diverse local economies; andFood transitions towards revitalising indigenous and local food systems.Joji Carino, Forest Peoples Programme, launched the report as part of the 15 September event. According to theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, Carino said IPLCs are underrepresented in national strategies and action plans, “despite agreement that putting culture and the rights of IPLCs at the heart of biodiversity strategy can bring about positive outcomes.”The event also launched a review of progress towards theGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020.

23 September 2019: A global initiative, launched under the Industry Transition Track of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit, will help guide the world’s heaviest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting industries towards the low-carbon economy. The ‘Leadership Group for Industry Transition’ will drive transformation in hard-to-decarbonize and energy-intensive sectors.The Group was announced by India and Sweden, with Argentina, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea and the UK, and a group of companies, including Dalmia Cement, DSM, Heathrow Airport, LKAB, Mahindra Group, Royal Schiphol Group, Scania, SpiceJet, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp and Vattenfall.Supported by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Energy Transitions Commission, Mission Innovation, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the European Climate Foundation, among other partners, the Group will engage in an ambitious, public-private effort to ensure that heavy industries and mobility companies “can find a workable pathway to deliver” on the Paris Agreement on climate change.Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, India, expressed hope that work under the Industry Transition Track will “facilitate early diffusion of technology and support to developing countries.” Welcoming the partnership, WEF Founder and Executive Chairman, Klaus Schwab, said the Forum will help India, Sweden and other partners to “deploy the innovative models and technologies we know are needed to solve our most complex and stubborn carbon emission reduction challenges.”According to a Climate Action Summit press release, the heavy industry sector, including hard-to-abate and energy-intensive sectors like steel, cement, aluminum, aviation and shipping, is expected to be responsible for 15.7 gigatons (Gt) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Therefore, “international collaboration between countries and industry groups is critical to establish workable policy frameworks and incentives and to enable joint investment into low-carbon infrastructure” in order to reduce emissions and accelerate transition to low-carbon industrial development while pursuing efforts to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

24 September 2019: Ahead of the Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, co-leads of the Resilience and Adaptation Coalition, Egypt and the UK, with coalition partners, Bangladesh, Malawi, the Netherlands and Saint Lucia, supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), issued a Call for Action on Adaptation and Resilience, advocating for a vision that puts adaptation at the center of decision making.As of 23 September, the Call for Action has been supported by 112, mostly developing, countries, 16 UN agencies and international financial institutions and 68 organizations.We must step up efforts to close the gap in adaptive capacity and financing, and to remove the barriers that hinder the uptake of knowledge and technology.Recognizing that adaptation action is not keeping pace with the scale of climate change impacts, which is such that business-as-usual (BAU) “is no longer an option for any country, community, business or financial institution,” the Call to Action states that “equal and increased urgency” must be given to adaptation to impacts and to building resilience for the future. It warns that while the true costs of adaptation in developing countries could amount to USD 300 billion per year by 2030, there are “substantial benefits to be gained from acting now.” “We must step up efforts to close the gap in adaptive capacity and financing, and to remove the barriers that hinder the uptake of knowledge and technology,” the Call notes.The Call envisions a climate-resilient future where adaptation is placed at the core of decision making, immediate action is taken to protect people, economies and the environment and no person is left behind by the impacts of climate change.The Call urges for enhanced adaptation and resilience action in three areas:Acting now to respond to immediate climate impacts and to support the most vulnerable members of society, including by: scaling up disaster readiness and response capacity and improving access to climate risk insurance; intensifying efforts to increase food and water security; and prioritizing regional and country-owned approaches, especially in small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs);Building resilient futures by putting climate risk at the center of decision making, including by: integrating adaptation and resilience into long-term planning; increasing the resilience of economies and financial systems by integrating climate risk into investment decision making and business planning; and accelerating transition to resilient land use and ecosystems; andUrgently increasing the availability of adaptation and resilience finance.Progress towards the Call’s goals will be assessed in the margins of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC and COP 26, including progress achieved through the various initiatives launched at the Climate Action Summit. The 2020 Global Adaptation Action Summit and theYear of Actionlaunched by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) will also serve as opportunities to further accelerate adaptation action.

10 October 2019: A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cautions that obesity-related diseases will claim more than 90 million lives in OECD countries over the next 30 years, reducing life expectancy by nearly three years. The publication notes that the disease will also reduce gross domestic product (GDP) by 3.3% in OECD countries and impact personal budgets through additional expenses as high as USD 360 per capita per year.Launched on 10 October 2019, the report titled, ‘The Heavy Burden of Obesity – The Economics of Prevention,’ uses microsimulation modelling to analyze obesity and overweight in 52 countries (including OECD, EU and G20 countries). The publication makes an economic case for urgently scaling up investments in policies to promote healthy lifestyles and tackle the growing global public health problem of obesity. The report also proposes a number of policies that could improve health outcomes while being a good investment for countries.According to the authors, more than 50% of the population is currently overweight in 34 out of 36 OECD countries, and almost one in four people is obese, with average rates of adult obesity in OECD countries having increased from 21% in 2010 to 24% in 2016. OECD countries already spend 8.4% of their total health budget on treating obesity-related diseases: a total of USD 311 billion, or USD 209 per capita, per year. The publication highlights that obesity is responsible for 70% of treatment costs for diabetes, 23% for cardiovascular diseases and 9% for cancers.The report notes that children who are overweight do less well at school and are more likely to miss school and to complete higher education. They also show lower life satisfaction.The authors report that obese adults are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, as well as reduced life expectancy. In the EU, the publication finds that women and men in the lowest income group are respectively 90% and 50% more likely to be obese compared to those with the highest incomes, entrenching inequality. People suffering from at least one chronic disease associated with being overweight are 8% less likely to be employed the following year and, when they have a job, they are 3.4% more likely to be absent or less productive.According to the report, every dollar invested in preventing obesity would generate an economic return of up to six dollars. Solutions could include: food and menu labelling; prescription of physical activity by primary care doctors; workplace wellness programmes; increased access to active public transport; promotion of physical activity in schools; regulation of advertising of unhealthy food to children; and food reformulation.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) expects that world trade will fall by 13% to 32% in 2020, due to the disruptions to economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Theexpectationswere discussed during a trade forecast press conference on 8 April 2020. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo highlighted that the crisis “is first and foremost a health crisis which has forced governments to take unprecedented measures to protect people’s lives.”The WTO offered two scenarios, noting that estimates of the expected recovery in 2021 are uncertain, and that recovery will depend on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy responses. Azevêdo emphasized the need to take action now to lay the foundations for a strong, sustained, and socially inclusive recovery.Under an optimistic scenario, the WTO projects that recovery will be strong enough to bring trade close to its pre-pandemic trend. A pessimistic scenario envisages a partial recovery only. Both scenarios expect that all regions will experience double-digit declines in exports and imports in 2020, except for the “Other regions” (Africa, Middle East and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) including associate and former member States). The reason for this disparity is that those countries are heavy exporters of energy products, and demand for these products is relatively unaffected by fluctuating prices.While many look to compare expectations for the current crisis with the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the WTO notes that the pandemic’s restrictions on movement and need for social distancing affect labor supply, transport, and travel in ways that were not present for the financial crisis. With the current situation, economic sectors ranging from hotels, restaurants, and tourism to non-essential retail trade, as well as some manufacturing, have been severely impacted. In addition, complex value chains have been affected by the pandemic, in particular for electronics and automotive products.In related news, the WTO and World Customs Organization (WCO) have pledged to collaborate to facilitate trade in essential goods such as medical supplies, food, and energy. In ajoint statementreleased on 6 April 2020, the Secretariats of the two organizations note that they have invited their members to increase transparency by sharing information on new trade and trade-related measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The joint statement also urges members to “ensure that any new border action is targeted, proportionate, transparent and non-discriminatory — as agreed by G20 leaders,” and to rescind the measures once they are no longer needed.SDG 17 includes a number of trade-relatedtargets, including promotion of a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the WTO (target 17.10) and significantly increasing the exports of developing countries (target 17.11).
Forty-eight countries are expected to present their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) during the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.In mid-February 2020,51 countrieswere listed for presenting VNRs during the 2020 HLPF. Since then, two first-time presenters (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Bolivia) have rescheduled their presentation to the 2021 HLPF session. Belize was expected to present a second VNR at HLPF 2020, but is no longer on the schedule.Three fewer countries will present VNRs than anticipated, and the updated programme provides for presentations on “building back better after COVID.”The overarching theme for HLPF 2020 is, ‘Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ An updatedschedulefor HLPF 2020, released on 14 May, anticipates that the first three days will consist of presentations on themes related to “building back better after COVID.” VNR presentations will begin on the fourth day of the HLPF, 10 July, and will continue until the final day, 16 July.The Bureau of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is making adjustments to the format and programme of the 2020 session light of the COVID-19 pandemic and expected limitations on in-person meetings and international travel. The UN is exploring technological solutions for virtual sessions and interaction, including for the VNR presentations, due to the fact that any potential physical participation will be limited to New York-based delegates only. All side eventswill be virtual.Of the 48 scheduled VNRs, 26 countries will be presenting for the first-time and 21 countries will be presenting for the second-time. Benin will be the only country presenting a third VNR.The 26 first-time presenters are: Austria, Barbados, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russian Federation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.The 21 second-time presenters are: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.In 2021, the Marshall Islands will join the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Bolivia as first-time presenters. Bhutan, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Laos, Slovakia, Spain, and Thailand are also scheduled to present second VNRs. [VNR database]
On the sidelines of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 25), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) launched its Global E-Mobility Program that will help an initial group of 17 developing countries to set conducive policy and regulatory environments, ensure effective technology transfer, and facilitate private sector engagement and access to commercial finance for the introduction of e-vehicle fleets.The event titled, ‘Decarbonizing Transport: Promoting E-Mobility in Developing Countries,’ convened on 6 December 2019 in Madrid, Spain.During the discussions, panelists highlighted the need for,inter alia: private and publicly accessible charging infrastructure to power e-mobility; larger battery capacities in e-vehicles; policies that prohibit the import of low-quality, high-emission vehicles; and sufficient investments into e-mobility, which could save USD 6 trillion a year.Disruptive technologies are an opportunity to address carbon emissions and reduce vehicular congestion.Moreover, the event underscored: that disruptive technologies provide an opportunity to address carbon emissions as well as reduce vehicular congestion in urban spaces; the importance of e-mobility to addressing both the climate and air quality crises; and that the addition of transport electrification to all other current decarbonization actions would still be insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goals.Speakers also discussed specific efforts of countries, underscoring that,inter alia:Madrid has the largest bus fleet in Spain that runs on compressed natural gas, and it aims to improve its charging system to cater to over 650 electric buses by 2027;e-mobility is one of the decarbonization strategies for the transport sector addressed in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Mauritius;the current lack of capacity, finance, awareness, and infrastructure in Mauritius are barriers to establishing a fully electric bus transit system;bus-driver buy-in is essential for transitioning to electric buses; andinstalling solar panels on buses in Antigua and Barbuda has facilitated driver buy-in, increasing ridership and decreasing driver costs.The USD 33 million program will be implemented by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).

The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published it latest Interim Economic Outlook, which warns that the coronavirus (COVID-19) presents the global economy with its greatest threat since the financial crisis.The Outlook, titled, ‘Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk,’ investigates best- and worst-case scenarios and calls on governments to act immediately to limit the spread of the virus, protect people and businesses from its effects, and strengthen economic demand.The report notes that broader spread of the virus across the wider Asia-Pacific region and advanced economies could result in global growth as low as 1.5% this year, cutting in half the OECD’s 2020 projection from November 2019. Containment measures and loss of confidence could reduce production and spending and lead to a recession in some countries.G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus.The report calls for flexible working situations to keep as many jobs as possible, and implementation of temporary tax and budgetary measures to soften the impact in affected sectors, such as travel and tourism. The OECD also calls for adequate liquidity in the most affected countries to enable banks to help companies with cash-flow problems while containing the virus.The report points out that the G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence. The Outlook concludes that,inter alia:contractions in China are being felt globally, reflecting China’s critical role in global supply chains, travel and commodity market;outbreaks in other economies are having similar effects;prospects for China have been revised, with growth slipping below 5% in 2020, before recovering to over 6% in 2021, as output returns to levels projected prior to the outbreak of the virus;the adverse impacts on confidence, financial markets, the travel sector and disruption to supply chains contribute to the downward revisions in all G20 economies in 2020; anda longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America could cause global growth could drop to 1.5% in 2020, half the projected rate prior to the outbreak.The Outlook calls for: ensuring well-resourced public health measures to prevent infection and contagion; implementing policies that support health care systems and workers; and protecting incomes of vulnerable social groups and businesses. The report further states that macroeconomic policies can help restore confidence and demand recovery as outbreaks ease, but that it cannot offset immediate disruptions from enforced shutdowns and travel restrictions. If growth is weaker for an extended period of time, coordinated multilateral action will be required. [OECD News Story] [Publication Landing Page] [Publication:Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk]
The Secretaries-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have issued a joint statement in support of keeping ships moving, ports open, and cross-border trade flowing during the COVID-19 pandemic.In the statement, dated 8 June 2020, IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim and UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi outline the impact of COVID-19 on those who operate the world’s merchant ships. The statement highlights the importance of maritime transport, which carries more than 80% of global trade by volume and is dependent on over 2 million seafarers. However, the statement estimates that starting in mid-June 2020, approximately 300,000 seafarers per month will need to take international repatriation flights (whether by air or sea) in order to enable changeover of the ships’ crews. Such changeover is necessary, the statement emphasizes, to reduce fatigue, ensure safe operations and crew well-being, and to comply with international safety and employment regulations.Accordingly, IMO and UNCTAD encourage governments and relevant authorities to designate seafarers, including marine personnel, fishing vessel personnel, offshore energy sector personnel, and service providers at ports “key workers” that provide essential services and therefore are exempted from travel restrictions.Similarly, the statement calls for efforts to “identify and remove any unnecessary regulatory obstacles to post-pandemic recovery.” Approaches include exemptions, waivers, electronic solutions and sharing of pre-arrival information. Highlighting the potential benefits of these measures in a post-pandemic world, the statement notes that the actions can encourage further investment in digitalization, energy efficiency efforts, and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions from shipping.The Secretaries-General close by underscoring the need to keep ships moving, ports open, and cross-border trade flowing, and to avoid logistics obstacles that could potentially lead to supply shortages.
