"The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) has issued a report examining the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the Asia-Pacific region and outlining an agenda for cooperation.The technical and policy-focused publication titled, ‘State of the Region: Special report on COVID-19,’ acknowledges high levels of policy uncertainty in the region due to the pandemic, as well as the scale and duration of related economic and social shocks, and pace of recovery. The report thus focuses on how regional cooperation can provide governments with more options for recovery in the face of these uncertainties.The report collates a set of proposals using data collected from 710 survey respondents in business, academia, government, and civil society between 9 May and 12 June 2020. The results show greater levels of pessimism on economic impacts to the region than official estimates indicate. The report points to regional stimulus efforts totaling approximately USD 5.4 trillion, and notes that while policymakers’ appetites are constrained by memories of recent financial crises, “regional economies have space for further stimulus.”Regional mechanisms, the authors emphasize, can facilitate the design and implementation of coordination and cooperation packages, and build a sense of direction to support future growth. They note that top priorities for regional cooperation include sharing pandemic preparedness practices, vaccine development, and three aspects of trade with respect to essential products: the facilitation of trade as a whole; the removal of export restrictions; and the removal of tariffs.Observing that the pandemic has both deepened and accelerated preexisting trends, the report notes the importance of human contact, but also opportunities around digital technology and the multitude of connections available. As schools remain shuttered in many parts of the world, the report notes remote learning opportunities, with the caveat that risks remain around the digital divide despite action being taken through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Internet and Digital Roadmap.To address the “first order” priorities stemming from the pandemic, the report recommends multilateral actions that facilitate regional progress on seven issue areas:Information sharing;Flow of essential products;Moving beyond gross domestic product (GDP);Facilitating e-commerce;Restarting travel;Minimizing disruption to supply chains; andContact tracing.A message from PECC co-chairs Don Campbell and Su Ge highlights that this year marks PECC’s 40th anniversary and that the rationale behind the Council’s establishment still rings true today. They note that “[w]e can only resolve this pandemic and economic crisis through effective cooperation.” [Publication:State of the Region Report: Impact of the Covid‐19 Crisis] [Publication Landing Page]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"15 July 2019: An event on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) highlighted the ways in which a community-based model of landscape management can enhance the resilience of local ecosystems, protect biodiversity and support sustainable livelihoods of rural communities.The side event titled, ‘SATOYAMA – Society Living in Harmony with Nature: An Inclusive Approach from Communities, Landscapes and Seascapes,’ was presented by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, and co-sponsored by: the Governments of Bhutan, Costa Rica and Japan, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP), the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and the UN University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS).The event shared lessons learned from the Satoyama Initiative, which envisions inclusive societies operating in harmony with nature and biodiversity in the production of landscapes and seascapes. It called for mainstreaming the landscapes and seascapes approach into national and sub-national policies, and illustrated the ways in which the Initiative contributes to implementation of SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 10 (reduced inequalities), 13 (climate action), 14 (life under water) and 15 (life on land).Speaking during the event, Satoru Morishita, Ministry of the Environment, Japan, argued that the Satoyama Initiative can provide guidance for implementing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework by promoting area-based management and conservation outside protected areas.Kazuhiko Takeuchi, IGES and UNU-IAS, said the Initiative seeks to,inter alia, integrate traditional ecological knowledge and modern science, and explore new forms of co-management systems.Yoko Watanabe, GEF-SGP, UN Development Programme (UNDP), explained that Community Development and Knowledge Management for the Satoyama Initiative (COMDEKS) applies a community-based landscape approach for conserving ecosystems and biodiversity, while promoting sustainable livelihoods, and has developed and implemented 20 Integrated Land/Seascape Strategies with 216 projects in 20 countries, with over 70,000 community beneficiaries.Speakers also noted that: the Satoyama Initiative has empowered local communities through the Gamri Watershed project in eastern Bhutan; and the GEF-SGP, through COMDEKS, has promoted sustainable livelihoods of indigenous peoples, established biological corridors, and managed water resources in Costa Rica.The International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) is a global platform aimed at facilitating and accelerating implementation of activities under the Satoyama Initiative. It was launched in 2010 to promote network, collaboration and research that contributes to the CBD, SDGs and Socio-Ecological Production Landscapes and Seascapes (SEPLS). COMDEKS provides grants to civil society and community-based organizations to catalyze participatory landscape planning and undertake projects to increase community resilience and to maintain, rebuild and revitalize SEPLS.IISD Reporting Services is providing coverage ofselected side eventsduring the 2019 HLPF.

"The 33rd UN-Water Meeting offered a brief chance for the Members, Partners, and observers of this UN interagency coordination mechanism to discuss the role of water and sanitation in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants also received updates on opportunities to engage at the global level to build momentum for implementation of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).This meeting was originally scheduled to take place in August 2020, in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the open session took place as a 90-minute online discussion on 29 September 2020.Of particular focus was the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework, which waslaunchedin July 2020 by UN-Water with the participation of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres and 11 UN agency heads. UN-Water Chair Gilbert Houngbo highlighted that the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework calls for an annual “moment” for SDG 6 during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) when it convenes each July under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The SDG 6 Moment would provide an opportunity to assess progress and share success stories.An additional area of discussion was the UN-Water “offer,” which identifies ways that UN-Water Members and Partners can help support UN country teams through the UN resident coordinator (RC) system. Following the delivery of the offer in January, country teams from the following eight countries have replied: Bahrain, Costa Rica, Guinea, India, Madagascar, Mexico, Nepal, and São Tomé and Príncipe.Participants were also updated on preparations for upcoming high-level events at the UN on water and sanitation issues. Madhushree Chatterjee, UN-Water Secretary, said the President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) will organize one of the two high-level events by June 2021, so that it may contribute to the July 2021 session of the HLPF.The year 2023 marks the midpoint of the Water Action Decade (2018-2028), and a UN Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action, ‘Water for Sustainable Development,’ will convene from 22-24 March 2023. Mahmadamin Mahmadaminov, Permanent Representative of Tajikistan, and Mark Zellenrath, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Netherlands, noted their countries’ efforts as co-facilitators regarding the modalities for the event. Chatterjee reported that regional preparatory meetings will take place in 2022 for the Midterm Review meeting.During a closed meeting for UN-Water Members on 30 September 2020, it was agreed that the 34th UN-Water meeting will convene virtually from 16-17 March 2021.

"May 2019: Participants from multi-stakeholder bodies and initiatives, CSOs and networks, the business sector, academia, regional and local levels, and parliaments gathered for the second meeting of the Open SDGclub.Berlin at the invitation of the German Council for Sustainable Development (RNE). Participants exchanged solutions-oriented ideas, discussed what is being done at the local, national, regional and global levels to implement the SDGs, and highlighted challenges and discussed ways to deal with them.The event took place from 7-9 May 2019, in Berlin, Germany, and brought together 60 sustainability practitioners from over 30 countries.Among other agenda items, participants met with the Advisory Committee on Sustainable Development of the German Bundestag to discuss the role of parliaments in implementing the 2030 Agenda. German sustainability actors joined the meeting on the final day to exchange information about their experiences with SDG-related initiatives. The meeting concluded with a discussion with representatives from the two German ministries responsible for SDG implementation: the Federal Ministry for the Environment and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation.During the meeting, participants met in four teams to discuss challenges and opportunities related to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), multi-stakeholder bodies and processes, subnational implementation of SDGs, and initiatives and projects. Recommendations from each of the teams were shared with the full group, and included:stakeholders should be involved in deliberations on issues that concern those stakeholders, such as the development of HLPF Guidelines for Partnerships;the search for partners and building of alliances across stakeholders requires the use of a common language;data is fundamental for initiating projects;links between the SDGs and existing best practices should be identified;before being presented to HLPF, Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) should be presented to the relevant national government; andthere should be a focus on regular and transparent VNR follow-ups at the national level.Participants discussed and agreed, in their personal capacities, on a Call for Action that:calls for all Heads of State to raise the level of awareness of and commitment to implementing and following up the 2030 Agenda;calls for all parties to use the UN HLPF as the one relevant global mechanism for coordinating and monitoring the 2030 Agenda; andencourages all stakeholders to advance the multi-stakeholder and multi-level approaches to the 2030 Agenda, respecting the needs of future generations.[Open SDGclub.Berlin Call for Action] [SDG Knowledge Hub summary of first Open SDGclub.Berlin meeting][SDG Knowledge Hub sources]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"14 October 2019: Building cities sustainable enough to meet future needs will require new ways of thinking and working, as well as new kinds of multi-stakeholder initiatives and partnerships, according to a flagship report published by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and UN-Habitat. The publication explores future policy pathways for policymakers and stakeholders to “reimagine the built and natural environments in the region’s cities.”The report titled, ‘The Future of Asian and Pacific Cities: Transformative Pathways Towards Sustainable Urban Development,’ describes 15 policy pathways across four priorities to guide future urbanization: urban and territorial planning; urban resilience; smart and inclusive cities; and urban finance. Taken together, it argues, these pathways comprise “a guidebook for future urbanization” in the Asia-Pacific region, which became majority urban in 2019 for the first time, with more than 2.3 billion people living in cities. The report maintains that these pathways are critical for realizing the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda (NUA), and evaluates their implications for achieving inclusive sustainable development in cities by 2030.The Asia-Pacific region became majority urban in 2019 for the first time, with more than 2.3 billion people living in cities.On urban and territorial planning, the report provides an overview of the state of planning and recent successes in the region. Recommended pathways include: integrating sustainability and quality-of-life targets into planning to future-proof investment in cities; co-producing, with citizens, planning solutions that align technological investment with local government capacities; and identifying urban regeneration and growth strategies that optimize urban-rural and city-region collaborations to drive sustainability and investment.On urban resilience activities, as well as shocks and stresses, such as natural disasters, economic reliance on single industries, and an aging population, suggested pathways include:scaling up use of nature-based solutions and resilient infrastructure in integrated urban and climate change planning;understanding the informal economy and supporting the urban poor to be change agents;creating and strengthening partnerships to bring more attention and resources to long-term urban resilience strategies; andutilizing big data sources to connect communities, cities and regions and improve technological literacy.On smart and inclusive cities, the report addresses the digital revolution’s implications for cities, and the region’s adoption of smart city key performance indicators and plans, combined with new technologies to manage city services. However, it also notes potential limitations of overreliance on technology, including failure to address the digital divide. Suggested pathways include: improving smart city governance; encouraging technology firms to become more civic minded and create sustainable smart city solutions with social enterprises; adopting cybersecurity safeguards; developing smart mobility investment; and expanding viable smart city funding mechanisms.On urban finance, the report focuses on types of finance most likely to offer sustainable and inclusive solutions for the region, and suggests the following pathways: scaling up public-private partnerships (PPPs) and community schemes to transition to localized housing finance solutions; adopting land-linked financing mechanisms that leverage urban growth to build people-centered urban infrastructure; and employing congestion charging and environmental user fees.The report was released on the eve of the seventh Asia-Pacific Urban Forum, which convened in Penang, Malaysia, from 15-17 October 2019. [Publication:The Future of Asian and Pacific Cities 2019: Transformative Pathways Towards Sustainable Urban Development] [Publication Landing Page]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1
"24 September 2019: The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has issued the results of a study on costing and financing the SDGs in the world’s 59 low-income developing countries. It highlights a SDG financing gap of USD400 billion per year for these countries, and notes that LIDC governments will require a substantial increase in fiscal revenues far beyond what they can achieve through their own fiscal reforms.The SDSN paper,issuedon 23 September 2019, was prepared by theSDSN Costing and Financing Teamwith inputs from the Working Group on SDG Costing and Financing (SDG Costing Group). The SDG Costing Group is convened by SDSN and co-chaired with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).The paper points to the importance of international cooperation to enable the LIDCs to meet the Goals. It outlines measures to help fill their financing gap including:mobilizing private investments in blended financing (USD50 billion);mobilizing increased revenues earmarked for SDG-related expenditures by closing international tax loopholes (USD50 billion);introducing globally harmonized taxes, such as wealth taxes for ultra-high net worth individuals (USD100 billion), financial transactions taxes (USD50 billion), and carbon taxes (USD50 billion);increasing and better targeting official development assistance (USD100 billion); andexpanding private philanthropy through the GivingPledge(USD30 billion).The paper further proposes a policy roadmap for 2020. The roadmap calls for,inter alia: a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution asking UN Member States to undertake the actions needed to close the SDG financing gap; multilateral agencies such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the UN to prioritize the mobilization of additional SDG financing; supporting country-level SDG planning, budgeting and implementation; multilateral international institutions, member countries and other relevant officials and stakeholders to focus on compiling more accurate fiscal profiles of countries and assessments to meet the SDGs; and expanding the role of global funds, while ensuring that global funds are well-resourced and well-designed.Per the paper, the ad hoc SDG Costing Group seeks to build a community of practice that can support country-level and global SDG costing and financial planning. The group – composed of approximately 60 members from various organizations – also works to mobilize best costing practices and costing tools to support lower-income countries with the preparation of budgetary frameworks, revenue strategies and development assistance strategies to achieve the SDGs. The findings of the group are expected to facilitate the work of national governments, among other actors, and inform the UNGA on matters related to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development (FfD). It should further inform the OECD-Development Assistance Committee (DAC) on its advice to donor governments on supporting the SDGs.The paper’s conclusions were presented during aneventon ‘The Cost of Success: Identifying SDG Financing Needs and Pathways for Low-Income Countries’ that took place on 24 September 2019, at the Permanent Mission of Denmark, during the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) high-level week.

"3 October 2019: Rainforest Foundation Norway has released a report that analyzes the impacts of the aviation industry’s emissions reduction goals on deforestation. The report cautions that the production of alternative aviation fuels is likely to drive forest clearance and generate carbon dioxide emissions from land use change, underscoring how emissions reductions goals in one sector can have a negative impact on others.The report titled, ‘Destination deforestation: Aviation biofuels, vegetable oil and land use change,’ explains that the aviation industry aims to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% in 2050, compared to the 2005 level, without limiting growth. The aviation industry plans to work towards this goal by shifting from conventional jet fuel to alternative aviation fuels. According to Rainforest Foundation Norway’s report, the only current technology operating at a commercial scale to produce aviation fuel from electricity is the ‘hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, or HEFA’ process, which produces jet fuel from animal fats and vegetable oils. The report raises concerns about the cost of fuels produced using HEFA or other alternatives and cautions that the HEFA industry’s sustainability and scalability is limited by the need for feedstock inputs, such as palm oil and soy oil, both of which are associated with tropical deforestation.The report questions “whether current rates of aviation growth can ever be sustainable in a carbon constrained world.”Based on the aviation industry’s projected fuel needs, the report states that, if palm and soy oils each contribute a quarter of the feedstock demand for the aviation industry goal, it “could drive 3.2 million hectares of forest loss and 5 gigatonnes of land use change carbon dioxide emissions.” The report concludes that the HEFA technology is “simply not appropriate to delivering the volumes […] needed for a large-scale transition to alternative fuels in the aviation industry” and therefore recommends identifying more commercially viable and scalable technology options. Within this context, the report questions “whether current rates of aviation growth can ever be sustainable in a carbon constrained world.”To avoid undermining the SDGs and limit global temperature rise, the report argues the aviation industry should avoid using biofuels from feedstocks, such as palm oil and soy, that have a high deforestation risk. The report therefore recommends reassessing the realistic potential for alternative aviation fuel deployment between now and 2050. The report further recommends,inter alia: focusing on mobilizing investment for demonstrating the potential of electrofuels and cellulosic biofuels at commercial scale; and reprioritizing additional options to decarbonize aviation, including electric propulsion and novel airframes.

"The Ottawa Group, comprised of 13 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, has released a statement outlining six action areas to focus on in light of COVID-19. Formed in the wake of the Ottawa Ministerial on WTO Reform, held 24-25 October 2018, the Group seeks to address specific challenges that are putting the multilateral trading system under stress.Addressing group members virtually on 15 June 2020, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo acknowledged that the current pandemic has placed additional strains on the system. Azevêdo emphasized the importance of the upcoming Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12), which has beenpostponedtentatively to June 2021, but nonetheless provides an opportunity to advance WTO reform initiatives and aid COVID-19 recovery efforts.The June 2020 statement of the Ottawa Group points to thinking already underway on “trade policy actions that would support an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient recovery” from the pandemic. The statement sets out six areas where actions can be taken:Transparency and withdrawal of trade-restrictive measures;Keeping open and predictable trade in agricultural and agrifood products;E-commerce;Trade facilitation – use of information technology and streamlined procedures;Initiative on medical supplies; andDeepen engagement with stakeholders.Ministers of the Group instruct officials to carry out “action points” on each of the six areas. On the first area relating to transparency, officials are instructed,inter alia, “to ensure any measures introduced in response to COVID-19 are promptly notified in accordance with relevant WTO requirements.” This includes a return to a quarterly cycle of trade monitoring reports, and supporting best practices to share information. Furthermore, officials must discuss the principle of COVID-19-related measures being “targeted, proportionate, transparent, temporary and consistent with WTO rules” and withdraw or end any trade-restrictive measures introduced in response to COVID-19 as quickly as possible.The statement flags that these focus areas and actions do not signify a reduction of interest by the Group in other priority areas such as reform of the organization (including reform of the WTO’s dispute settlement system for a long-lasting solution), and multilateral negotiations on harmful fisheries subsidies and agriculture. The Group also notes its support for joint statement initiatives including those on services domestic regulation, investment facilitation for development, and micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and signals that members also intend to remain active in discussions held outside the WTO to safeguard global supply chains.The 13 members of the Ottawa Group are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the EU, Japan, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, and Switzerland. In addition to the Ottawa Group, other working groups seeking to tackle WTO reform from different perspectives include atrilateral processbetween the EU, the US, and Japan, and a bilateral EU-USExecutive Working Group, among others.

"The human rights implications of chemicals and waste management were a topic of interest at a briefing organized by the Geneva Environment Network (GEN). The briefing focused on two recent reports from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Presentations included remarks from the UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, a role established 25 years ago due to growing concern about the dumping in Africa of hazardous waste generated in Europe.Held on 20 October 2020, thebriefingprovided an opportunity to discuss: a report onissues of concern, detailing eight emerging policy issues and other issues of concern identified under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), and reviewing how regulatory and policy frameworks address them; and a report onstrengthening the science-policy interface for chemicals and waste management, which assesses three options for such an interface: an independent platform; institutionalizing outlook development processes; and thematic subsidiary panels with specialized task forces. UNEP developed the reports in response to requests by the fourth UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) for consideration atUNEA-5.Marcos Orellana,UN Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights, said the science-policy interface is particularly important regarding human rights implications of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. He said the “right to science” in the human rights field is anchored in theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.He said criteria for a successful SPI in this area include credibility and independence, as well as transparency to prevent conflict of interest. He also highlighted the private sector’s role in the work of existing science-policy platforms in chemicals and waste, as well as the need to protect against inappropriate corporate influence. Orellana said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): preserves the integrity of the scientific debate; keeps discussions transparent; and enables access to the scientific evidences in which the assessments are based.In response to questions from participants, Orellana also discussed disclosure of information by manufacturers. He highlighted: the complexity of balancing the benefits of scientific progress with intellectual property rights (IPRs); the need for governments to establish regulatory mechanisms to ensure access to information; and risks that platforms may be captured by special interests.Felix Wertli, Switzerland, said the most effective SPI option for Switzerland is an intergovernmental panel, which would best prevent conflicts of interest and ensure scientific integrity. Speakers also pointed out that:The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS) have embedded SPI mechanisms, such as thePOPs Review Committeeunder the Stockholm Convention, and expert working groups, for example on plastic and on e-waste, under the Basel Convention;Digital tools are important to maximize the impact of SPI platforms; andVirtual working groups have been established during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure discussions continue on the post-2020 framework for chemicals and waste management.Discussions also addressed the current model of the Global Chemicals Outlook (GCO), adopted at UNEA, and its deficiencies regarding strengthening the SPI.Participants raised the need to strike a balance in the post-2020 instrument, including regarding funding, between the high-level, research/policy-oriented aspects and on-the-ground efforts on issues of concern. Exchanges also touched on technology transfer and institutional strengthening in developing countries, including through UNEP’sSpecial Programme on Institutional Strengthening for the Chemicals Cluster, which helps developing countries access funding and develop sound plans for managing chemicals and waste.

"18 September 2019: UN Secretary-General António Guterres announced an initiative aimed at ensuring that creating decent jobs and protecting livelihoods are at the center of countries’ efforts to ramp up climate action, and urged States to join the initiative.The ‘Climate Action for Jobs’ initiative was developed jointly by the Climate Action Summit, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and other members of the Summit’s Social and Political Drivers coalition, co-led by Spain and Peru. The initiative provides a roadmap to ensure that people’s jobs and well-being are at the core of the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.Launching the initiative, the Secretary-General noted that around 1.2 billion jobs, or 40% of world employment, “rely directly on a healthy and stable environment.” Warning that business “cannot succeed on a planet that fails,” and jobs “cannot be sustained on a dying planet,” Guterres urged governments, businesses and people everywhere to join efforts to “put climate action into a higher gear.”Business cannot succeed on a planet that fails. Jobs cannot be sustained on a dying planet.The initiative calls on countries to formulate national plans for a just transition while creating decent work and green jobs, and introduces specific measures to include in national plans, including:Assessing the employment, social and economic impacts of climate action;Implementing skills development and upgrading measures;Designing innovative social protection policies to protect workers and vulnerable groups;Increasing the transfer of technology and knowledge to developing countries, and innovation and responsible investment;Fostering a conducive business environment to enable enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to adopt low-carbon production processes;Devising economic policies and incentives to support and encourage enterprises’ transition towards the environmentally sustainable production of goods and services; andCreating mechanisms for inclusive social dialogue to build consensus for transformative and sustainable change.The ILO ‘Guidelines for a Just Transition Towards Environmentally Sustainable Economies and Societies for All,’ adopted through tripartite consensus, provide a framework to guide countries’ transition to low-carbon economies.The initiative was launched on 18 September, and subsequently presented at the Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit on 23 September at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Implementation of the initiative will be spearheaded by the ILO, with support from other partners in the Social and Political Drivers action area, including the B-Team, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and the International Organisation of Employers (IOE).

"July 2019: The UN released two resources on partnerships for small island developing States (SIDS) in preparation for the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) high-level review of the SAMOA Pathway. The SIDS Partnership Toolbox provides criteria and norms, as well as guidance on getting started with a partnership, setting up a governance framework and a monitoring programme, communicating with stakeholders and accessing financing. A report analyzes trends in SIDS partnerships.The SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway is the outcome of the Third International Conference on SIDS, which took place in September 2014, in Apia, Samoa. The document covers the period 2015-2025, and promotes international assistance to address challenges faced by small islands. The high-level meeting will serve as a mid-term review of the agreement, and will convene on 27 September 2019. The political declaration to be adopted during the review meeting is still under negotiation by UN Member States.The SIDS Partnership Toolbox builds on consultations made through a series of partnershipdialoguesfor SIDS that took place in 2018 to support the preparatory process for the High-level Review. The toolbox was officially launched during the Global Multi-stakeholder SIDS PartnershipDialoguein July 2019. It is produced by the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).Thetoolboxincludes sections on: participate and contribute, design, evaluate, analyze and explore, and learn. It direct users to platforms toregistera partnership for SIDS, and to report on partnershipprogress. It also presents partnershipcase studiesand a partnershipquiz. On SIDS partnership criteria and norms, the toolbox says that these provide a good starting point for articulating a genuine and durable partnership. The criteria are presented as a version of the ‘SMART‘ criteria: SIDS specific, Measurable and monitorable, Achievable and accountable, Resource-based and results-focused, and Timeline for implementation and transparency by all parties.Also in preparation for the SAMOA Pathway review, DSDG issued areportanalyzing the status and trends of 555 partnerships for SIDS that have been announced and registered with the UN Secretariat. Among other observations, the report indicates that:the Pacific region has registered the highest number of partnerships, followed by the Caribbean region and the region of Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS);in March 2019, a large number of partnerships had completed their activities, and more were coming to an end “shortly;”governments, regional organizations and UN entities lead most of the listed partnerships;all SAMOA Pathway priority areas are addressed by the listed partnerships, but an overall stronger focus is found on oceans and seas, climate change, sustainable economic growth, renewable energy and disaster risk reduction;among global partnerships, climate change and resilience represent the largest priority area “by far,” while other commonly addressed areas include biodiversity and oceans, access to education, particularly higher education, access to technologies, data and information, and renewable energy. Under-represented areas include social development, poverty, gender equality, sustainable consumption and production, health and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and sustainable transportation.The report also discusses,inter alia, the positive impacts of partnerships, as well as gaps encountered and challenges.

"12 July 2019: For the first time, the 2019 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Economic Growth Report explicitly includes environmental sustainability considerations. Titled ‘Going for Growth 2019,’ the report has an increased focus on reforms to make growth environmentally sustainable.It calls for the better use of environmental taxation, the phase out of agricultural subsidies and environmentally harmful tax breaks, and additional steps to reduce transport emissions, including more investment in better and low-emission public transport.Overall, the 2019 report finds slow growth, high uncertainty, and rising levels of inequality, and it urges policy makers to take action to achieve stronger, sustainable, and more inclusive growth. The publication underscores that economic growth is weakening at a time when “key forces” such as globalization, digitalization, population aging, and environmental degradation are shaping economic developments. To address these megatrends, it recommends country-specific structural reforms that boost long-term growth, improve competitiveness and productivity, create jobs, and ensure a cleaner environment.However, the 2019 assessment of top structural reform priorities in 46 OECD and non-OECD countries and their progress on key reforms finds “a disappointing pace of reforms in 2017-2018.” Education was the most common reform priority across countries.The report makes the case for improving the conditions for labor market inclusion of women, migrants, minorities, and older workers, as prerequisites for sustainable economic growth. It also underlines that innovation policies need to support “radical innovation” and the diffusion and adoption of new technologies. It further emphasizes that restoring a multilateral, rules-based system is crucial, especially in areas like climate change, tax evasion and profit shifting, competition, trade, and migration.

"Sixteen years after the World Trade Organization (WTO) began negotiations on fisheries subsidies at the Doha Ministerial Conference, its Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11) is expected to take up the issue when it meets in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this December. In advance of this meeting, the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR), tasked with “developing stronger rules while respecting the important policy concerns of WTO members” met twice in October to progress negotiations towards a fisheries subsidies outcome.MC11comes at a time of enhanced global momentum and action on ocean issues. The universally agreed 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015, includes a Sustainable Development Goal focused on the ocean (SDG 14) and a target to regulate and end destructive and illegal fishing practices (target 14.4) by 2020. In 2016, the UN held thefirst World Ocean Conferenceto support action towards the achievement of SDG 14.Regarding fisheries subsidies, on 28 July 2017, the NGR Chair, Ambassador Wayne McCook (Jamaica), circulated a compilation matrix reflecting seven textual proposals. The matrix includes seven proposals from: New Zealand, Iceland and Pakistan; the European Union; Indonesia; the African, Caribbean, Pacific (ACP) Group of States; a Latin American group composed of Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru and Uruguay; the Least-Developed Countries (LDC) Group; and Norway. According to the WTO, each proposal supports reaching a decision for MC11. [WTO Press Release, 28 July 2017] [WTO Introduction to Fish Subsidies]In September, Bloom and the Varda Group published a brief titled, ‘The Low Hanging Fish,’ which reviews these ‘seven WTO proposals addressing harmful fisheries subsidies.’ The brief outlines the key issues of: scope of the subsidies prohibitions; overfished stocks; overcapacity; exemptions; geographic scope; special and differential treatment; transparency; technical cooperation; and the transitional period. For each issue, the authors offer a comparison across the seven proposals as well as their recommendations for a way forward.From this text, the Chair “identified issues where he believed members were in general agreement.”Most recently, on 13 October, theWTO reportedprogress from the NGR meeting, which led to a compilation text, based on these proposals. From this text, Chair Ambassador McCook “identified issues where he believed members were in general agreement.” These issues included the scope and the nature of the measures to be covered, and the subsidies contributing to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and those harming fish stocks, “notwithstanding important technical and political hurdles to overcome in both areas.” He also highlighted the areas of greatest divergence, such as on “technical aspects and effects of certain capacity- and effort-enhancing subsidies” and special and differential treatment provisions for developing and least-developed countries. The NGR is meeting from 31 October-3 November, to read through this compilation text.For additional information, reference also, ‘An Ocean in Chains,’ which reviews the links of fisheries subsides and related issues to SDG 14.

"24 September 2019: Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB), a joint initiative of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), released its annual report for 2018-2019 on TIWB’s activities from May 2018 to April 2019. Since 2012, TIWB audit assistance has yielded an additional USD 480 million in tax revenue.In 2015, OECD and UNDP launched the TIWB initiative at the Third Financing for Development (FfD) Conference to strengthen international cooperation on building capacity in developing countries to attain the SDGs. Both the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the SDGs highlight the importance of tax revenues for development. Tax revenues provide funding for governments to reduce poverty, deliver public services and build physical and social infrastructure for long-term development. The TIWB initiative embeds expert tax auditors in tax administrations in developing countries to build the capacity of local tax officials. The initiative aims to ensure that developing countries collect the taxes due from profits earned by multinational enterprises.The ‘TIWB Annual Report 2018/2019’ finds increasing demand for TIWB programmes across all regions of the world. In 2016, the TIWB Governing Board set a target of launching 100 TIWB programmes by 2020. By April 2019, TIWB had 88 current, completed and upcoming programmes, indicating that the initiative is “well on its way to achieving this target.” There has also been an increased emphasis on South-South cooperation, with India, Mexico, Morocco and South Africa providing support to the initiative.Alongside the additional revenues raised as a result of a TIWB programme, the annual report highlights the many additional core benefits that result from TIWB engagement. Tax officials in developing companies are gaining the knowledge they need to “identify when their big taxpayers are not paying the correct amount” as well as the confidence and skills to engage with taxpayers to ensure correct collection of taxes.The report highlights lessons learned for implementing TIWB programmes around the world, such as the importance of a dedicated, core tax audit team to provide continuity and help institutionalize good practices. Senior-level leadership within host administrations can help insulate auditors from external pressures. Other best practices include aligning legislation with international best practices; involving a second tax expert who knows the local language and culture to help tax audit experts who may not be fluent in the local language; providing remote assistance, including review of cases and support in drafting legislative amendments; and building a community of practice to exchange experiences.TIWB presented the report during a ministerial panel themed, ‘Tax Inspectors Without Borders: Four Years and Half a Billion Dollars Later,’ which convened on the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). TIWB Governing Board Co-Chairs Angel Gurria, OECD Secretary-General, and Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, presented the TIWB’s findings. Participants discussed the strengths and opportunities of the TIWB approach, and shared lessons on capacity development for domestic resource mobilization.

"11 July 2019: Looking ahead to the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) review of the functions of the HLPF, as well as the five-year milestone of SDG implementation, an event organized on the sidelines of HLPF 2019 shared civil society perspectives on how to organize the upcoming review and improve stakeholder engagement in the process.The event highlighted the outcomes of surveys carried out at the national, regional and global levels, and presented recommendations included in the Principles Paper for HLPF review developed by civil society networks, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that the HLPF fulfils its mandates of tracking progress, providing political guidance, and identifying gaps on achieving the SDGs.Recognizing the impact of the HLPF on regional and national implementation, the civil society initiative aimed to gather diverse voices to maximize the opportunity presented by the review process to improve global-level follow up and review mechanisms. During a panel discussion, speakers called for, among other issues: more ambition of the HLPF based on lessons learned; more time for presentation and discussion of Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) during the HLPF; a stronger focus on leaving no one behind; and better alignment and integration with other frameworks beyond the 2030 Agenda.Discussing some priorities for the next review cycle, participants agreed that the HLPF should focus on the principle of leaving no one behind and enhanced civil society engagement, at early stages of political discussions. The discussion also stressed the need for more solidarity and recognition of the role of local and national governments as vital elements for a successful 2030 Agenda.The event was co-organized by Together 2030, Action for Sustainable Development, the Transparency, Accountability, and Participation (TAP) Network, and Forus.

"7 August 2019: UN Member States have agreed on a five-paragraph text on strengthening alignment and coherence among the agendas of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and other UN bodies and fora in light of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.The elements were discussed through intergovernmental consultations and are provided as input to the Assembly’s annual resolution on the revitalization of its work.Discussions on alignment and coherence between UN organs started in 2016 during the 70th session of the UNGA, and continued during subsequent UNGA sessions. A mapping exercise of the SDGs and targets prepared during UNGA 70 showed that the targets of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) were “largely uncovered under the UNGA and ECOSOC agendas.”In November 2018, UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés appointed Maria Helena Lopes de Jesus Pires, Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste, and Marie Chatardová, Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic, to facilitate intergovernmental consultations on the alignment process during UNGA 73.The UNGA’s Main Committees will make proposals in the context of their respective agendas.Consultations started in March 2019, and on 1 August, the co-facilitators placed afinal compromise draftunder silence procedure. On 7 August, the UNGA Presidentannouncedthat the procedure had not been broken, and that the text will be sent to the Ad Hoc Working Group on the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly established by the UNGA.The agreed text of elements requests the President of the 74th UNGA, who will take office in September 2019, to identify proposals, through consultations, to address gaps, overlaps and duplication “where they are found to exist” in the agenda of the UNGA as they relate to the 2030 Agenda. It also calls on the UNGA’s main committees to make proposals in the context of their respective agendas for discussion during UNGA 74.The text further states that the updatedmappingassessment of SDG coverage by the UNGA, ECOSOC and other UN bodies and fora in light of the 2030 Agenda developed during UNGA 73 should be “an evolving reference document” for consideration by UN Member States during UNGA 74. It also takes note of the initial efforts made during UNGA 73 to develop possiblecriteriafor reducing overlaps and duplication.

"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has recommended a swift, internationally-coordinated policy response to lessen effects on worldwide unemployment, underscoring the “urgency of preparedness and early action.” The ILO proposes three urgent, large-scale measures to address the impacts of COVID-19 on the world of work.The preliminary assessment note, ‘COVID-19 and the world of work: Impacts and responses,’ was released on 18 March 2020. It observes that the crisis has “already transformed into an economic and labour market shock,” with impacts on both the production of goods and services as well as consumption and investment. The authors state that “all businesses, regardless of size, are facing serious challenges,” and sustaining business operations will be particularly difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The note further warns that prospects for the economy and the quantity and quality of employment are “deteriorating rapidly”.The note also points to “growing signs of a global economic recession,” and identify different scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on global GDP growth. The estimates indicate that global unemployment could rise by 5.3 million in a “low scenario” and 24.7 million in a “high scenario.”The authors calls for three key measures:Protecting workers in the workplace from the health risks of COVID-19;Stimulating the economy and employment; andSupporting jobs and incomes.To protect workers, the ILO recommends teleworking and staggered hours, increased paid sick leave, and occupational support, such as dedicated websites and hotlines. Additional protective measures could include childcare support for working parents when nurseries and schools are closed, and efforts to provide health access to all and prevent discrimination and exclusion relating to COVID-19.To stimulate the economy, the briefing proposes active fiscal and monetary policies, tax breaks and waivers for social security contributions, and extended deadlines for mortgage payments. In addition, the note says that financially supporting specific sectors, like the health sector, can help to mitigate coronavirus-related economic impacts. To support jobs and incomes, the note suggests compensation arrangements, work reduction, and social assistance. Some countries are introducing financial support for small business, and offering opportunities for affected companies to postpone social or tax installments. The note concludes by stressing that these measures will help, but cautions that preparedness and early action are critical.Releasing the assessment, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder warned that COVID-19 is “no longer only a global health crisis; it is also a major labor market and economic crisis” that is having a “huge impact on people.” Ryder stressed the importance of engaging with workers, employers, and their representatives to build trust and support for measures needed to overcome the crisis. He called for the type of leadership and resolve displayed in 2008 to address the consequences of the global financial crisis.ILO plans to update the note as new data and information become available.

"26 July 2019: The second part of the 25th annual session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which included meetings of the Authority’s Council and Assembly, focused on the Authority’s central consideration at this point in time: the development of the draft exploitation regulations on deep-seabed mining. These regulations, once concluded, will govern future activities in the world’s oceans.The regulations will need to ensure environmental protection while simultaneously balancing stakeholders’ interests.The ISA was established as an autonomous institution under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to organize and control activities in the Area, particularly with a view to administering the resources of the Area. “The Area” is defined as the seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, and its “resources” as all solid, liquid, or gaseous mineral resourcesin situin the Area at or beneath the seabed. Among other things, the ISA is mandated to provide for the necessary measures to ensure the effective protection for the marine environment from harmful effects, which may arise from mining activities in the Area.During its 25th session, the Council delved into the draft exploitation regulations, submitted by the Legal and Technical Commission (LTC), addressing provisions on,inter alia:applications for approval of Plans of Work in the form of contracts;rights and obligations of contractors; andprotection and preservation of the marine environment.The Assembly considered the implementation of the Authority’s Strategic Plan 2019-2023, including adoption of the High-Level Action Plan and the corresponding key performance indicators. The Assembly also adopted criteria and guidelines for applications for observer status in the work of the Authority.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreports that the July 2019 sessions were successful in advancing calls for environmental protection in deep-sea mining, operationalizing the Authority’s Strategic Plan, and shaping the organizational culture towards more participation and transparency. The increasing interest in the Authority’s work is testament to the increasing public awareness in deep-sea mining.Participants also commemorated the 25th anniversary of the ISA with a special session on Thursday, 25 July, attracting national delegations from more than 70 countries. In celebrating the 25th Anniversary, delegates expressed their intention to “ensure a thorough and timely development of the regulations, bearing in mind that necessary standards and guidelines should be developed before their adoption.” In addition, there were reminders through the Council meeting that “the regulations’ development does not take place in a vacuum.” They are influenced by the strategic direction of the Authority, which, for the first time in its history, has begun implementing a Strategic Plan. This Plan, in turn, decides the ISA’s positioning in the global oceanic realm and in environmental governance.The Council met from 15-19 July, and the Assembly from 22-26 July in Kingston, Jamaica. These meetings were preceded by meetings of the LTC (1-12 July) and the Finance Committee (8-10 July).The ISA Assembly and ISA Council will next meet in February 2020.

"26 June 2019: An event on the ‘Hidden Costs of American Food’ discussed the concept of true cost accounting (TCA) as a tool to account for the impacts food systems have on environment, health and social dimensions, and whether it is time for such a tool to be applied in US policy decision making.The event, which convened on the afternoon of 26 June 2019 in Washington, DC, involved presentations by expert panelists, followed by an interactive discussion with the participants. Panelists focused how TCA can provide the opportunity to align food systems with environmental, health and social policy to ensure that food policies do not exacerbate climate change, biodiversity loss, and human health impacts. The ensuing discussion explored current and prospective challenges to developing and applying TCA approaches, methodologies, and tools, and achieving their uptake by policymakers, including US policymakers, as well as by the private sector.Food production is one of the most complex and poorly understood systems in the world.In her opening remarks, Kathleen Merrigan, Executive Director, ASU Swette Center, said work on true cost accounting of food systems was timely, given concerns about climate change pressures, the need to achieve the SDGs, and to fight all forms of malnutrition. She stressed that TCA work is not about raising the cost of food to consumers, but rather providing a fuller accounting of all costs involved in food production. She explained that this information would facilitate the design of policies to keep food affordable, as well as aligning food systems with environmental, health and social policy priorities.Alexander Mueller, TEEBAgriFood Study Leader and Managing Director, TMG Research gGmbH, explained the rationale behind the TEEBAgriFood Evaluation Framework. He said food production is one of the most complex and poorly understood systems in the world, but important to change if the SDGs are to be attained. Mueller noted that all countries spend heavily on subsidizing food production without understanding whether they are subsidizing it well. He argued that food costs need to take into account the major impacts food systems have on environment, health and social dimensions, but cautioned that such analysis is complex and no one should expect simple answers.The event was co-sponsored by Arizona State University’s (ASU) Swette Center for Sustainable Food Systems and TMG Research gGmbH. It built on the work of the Evaluation Framework released in 2018 by the Agriculture and Food offshoot of The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity global initiative (“TEEBAgriFood”). The Framework seeks to contribute to comprehensive valuations of the eco-agri-food systems complex and demonstrate the externalities of farming systems, both negative and positive, in order to raise awareness of interlinkages among produced, natural, social, and human capital.

"An informal drafting group discussed potential elements for inclusion in a high-level declaration on the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020. The possible declaration would be adopted at the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), currently scheduled to convene in Bonn, Germany, from 5-9 July 2021.ICCM5 is expected to include a high-level segment to reaffirm political commitment to implementing sound chemicals and waste management beyond 2020, and its crucial contribution to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.The HLD Informal Drafting Group convened virtually on 24 November 2020 to discuss its aims and objectives, organizational matters, and the structure and approach of the proposed declaration. Gertrud Sahler, President of ICCM5, told the group she had intended to propose a process to develop a high-level declaration as part of the “beyond 2020” ICCM5 outcome, during the fourth meeting of the Intersessional Process (IP4) considering SAICM and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste beyond 2020. However, IP4 was postponed due to COVID-19.Given the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions, and the need to make progress on a successor agreement to the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), dialogue will take place virtually through the informal drafting group as well asTechnical BriefingsandVirtual Working Groups.The informal drafting group will compile, organize, and synthesize input, views, and proposals from SAICM stakeholders. These proposals will aim to inform the work of a more formal drafting group at the rescheduled IP4 (March 2021) or ICCM5 (July 2021).The informal drafting group is expected to address:Priorities and key messages for strengthening the sound management of chemicals and waste;Scope of the declaration, considering the current context (COVID-19, economic recovery interventions, and progressing on sound management), the contribution of sound management of chemicals and waste to implementing the 2030 Agenda, progress to date, and gaps to be addressed; andStructure of the declaration, including participation, responsibilities, and process to address current challenges.Acall for submissionsfrom stakeholders on essential elements for a possible declaration generated input from, among others, the African Group, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the EU, Iran, Iraq, Switzerland, the US, Friends of the Earth, International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), Pesticide Action Network International, UN Development Programme (UNDP), Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), Organisation for Economic and Development Co-operation (OECD), and International Council of Chemical Associations. Stakeholders were asked to address the most important aspects and key messages for strengthening the sound management of chemicals and waste, as well as political will.

"A group of UN economists has released a report aiming to set the stage for the high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary. The authors outline a role for the UN in building domestic political consensus to respond constructively to global megatrends, highlighting that the UN “can assist in mobilizing needed global support for individual countries, particularly those with fewer resources.”The ‘Report of the UN Economist Network for the UN 75th Anniversary: Shaping the Trends of Our Time’ was launched on 16 September 2020. The UN Economists Network is led by the UN Chief Economist.The UN’s 75th anniversary is an opportunity to forge a global commitment to digital cooperation, with goals, principles, and priority actions.It looks at the “outright failures in policy” that have resulted in climate change, environmental degradation, and inequalities. “Climate change and environmental degradation have no positive side, and must be reversed. Similarly, the overall impact of persistent and rising inequalities is negative,” although some people may emerge as short-term winners. Further, these megatrends cannot be fully shaped by national policy; they require all countries to act in concert, the report underscores.The economists offer guidance for policy makers on steering three other megatrends towards positive outcomes: demographic shifts, particularly population ageing; urbanization; and the emergence of digital technologies. On digital technologies, the report suggests that the UN is well placed to facilitate agreement on principles for “managing frontier technologies” and aligning the use of technology with ethical and human rights standards. The authors note that the UN’s 75th anniversary presents an opportunity for a global commitment to digital cooperation, which could enshrine goals, principles, and priority actions.On reducing inequality, the report asserts that support for policy responses to inequality often “runs into a wall of vested interests.” The UN can help governments overcome such political constraints, the authors offer.According to the report, achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking.” Policies to influence one megatrend as well as other megatrends that interact with it “can propel more effective, mutually reinforcing changes.” The authors stress that if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time in a direction that is sustainable and delivers benefits to all.” [Publication:Report of the UN Economist Network for the UN 75th Anniversary: Shaping the Trends of Our Time] [Executive Summary]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
"2 October 2019: The New Climate Institute released a paper that aims to help policymakers understand their country’s position in the power system transformation process. The paper highlights the importance of a shift in the global energy sector to limit climate change, ensure a secure energy supply and achieve sustainable development.The paper titled, ‘Transition Towards a Decarbonized Electricity Sector: A Framework for Analysis for Power System Transformation,’ argues that decarbonizing the power sector is critical in achieving transformation of the energy system and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The paper presents a qualitative assessment framework that aims to help policymakers understand transformation in the policy sector and analyze their country’s position, including challenges posed by the integration of variable renewable energy sources (vRES) that arise at different time periods. Common technical challenges encountered during integration of vRES in existing power systems include load balancing and reserve challenges, monitoring and control challenges, system non-synchronous penetration-related challenges, network congestion and restrictions from network operation, and system balance. The paper explains that specific challenges are likely to occur at particular phases, independent of a country’s socioeconomic or geographic characteristics. Network congestion and restrictions from network operations challenges start at the very early stages of a transition to renewable energy, for instance, but become essential to address once a country’s annual renewable energy share is between 25 and 40%.The paper finds that measures to address challenges in energy transformation “already exist and are readily available.” The paper underscores the importance of country-specific regulatory frameworks to promote full decarbonization of the power sector, and highlights different technical, policy and system interventions that countries can take.Selected country factsheets for Argentina, Germany, India, Ireland, Spain, Turkey, Kenya and Uruguay provide illustrations of how a country can assess the status of its power system transformation, and suggest policy options for consideration. For Argentina, for example, the factsheet states that the country’s growth plans for vRES capacity “are ambitious” and will require a stable, regulative framework and anticipating policies, including planning of new transmission capacity.

"19 September 2019: The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the University of Oxford have published a report on the role of nature-based solutions (NbS) in mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Titled, ‘Nature-based Solutions in Nationally Determined Contributions,’ the report overviews current levels of ambition inclusive of NbS and discusses how they can be used to further global climate action.The report finds that “although two-thirds of Paris Agreement signatories include nature-based solutions – actions to protect, restore and sustainably manage the world’s ecosystems – in their national climate targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement – these are currently not substantive or stringent enough.”The report further concludes that NbS synergies in adaptation and mitigation are underused, and there is a major opportunity to scale them up in a range of carbon-rich ecosystems, beyond forests. It suggests that wealthier countries may have a significant opportunity to increase ambition on NbS in their NDCs, and recognizes the urgency of enabling these solutions with the right conditions and enhanced finance.“Countries cannot afford to overlook nature’s full potential to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change,” said the IUCN Acting Director General.The report recommends to:Build on the increasing global recognition of the importance of ecosystems for addressing both climate change mitigation and adaptation, and fully incorporate NbS into future NDCs;Include NbS actions across a wide range of naturally occurring ecosystems;Step up NbS actions that address climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as support sustainable development and biodiversity conservation;Include more specific, measurable and robust NbS targets in NDCs and associated national implementation plans;Align NDCs with other relevant national plans and international processes;Mobilize funding; andInclude key NbS-relevant information in revised or new NDCs.Speaking on the report, IUCN Acting Director General Grethel Aguilar said that, “countries cannot afford to overlook nature’s full potential to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change.”The report was published ahead of theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.

The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is leading the Call, highlighting that groundwater is frequently mismanaged and urging action to match the SDGs’ timeline of 2030.The joint statement calls for a Global Groundwater Summit in 2022 and for sustainability plans to be implemented for over-exploited aquifers.IWMI hosts theGroundwater Solutions Initiative for Policy and Practice (GRIPP), which is supported by theCGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems(WLE). The research organizationemphasizesthat groundwater provides drinking water for more than two billion people and more than 40% of water for irrigation worldwide. It warns that groundwater is currently being mismanaged and has not received due attention in the SDGs, although groundwater is critical for drinking water supply (SDG 6), agriculture and food security (SDG 2), and energy generation (SDG 7).TheCall to Actionfeatures three main agenda items:draw attention to groundwater sustainability through a UN World Water Development Report and a Global Groundwater Summit in 2022;apply sustainability guiding principles by 2030 to managing groundwater, from local to global scales; andinvest in groundwater governance, through planning for nature-based solutions, capacity building, awareness raising, and monitoring and reporting systems.The Call highlights that groundwater plays a major role in achieving the SDGs and is a critical factor in bolstering resilience to the negative impacts of climate change, but is currently at risk from neglect, lack of understanding and poor management practices. It notes that less wealthy populations in developing countries are most at risk from falling water tables and contamination of groundwater sources.IWMIpresentsresearch indicating high levels of need in developing countries: for example, 60% of India’s groundwater aquifers are in critical condition, while the rapid growth in cities and urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa will require a quadrupling of water supply services by 2035, much of which will need to come from groundwater.",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The UN has released a joint agency report profiling the labor conditions of sanitation workers globally. The International Labour Organization (ILO), WaterAid, World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO) called the assessment the most extensive global study on this issue to date. The report was released ahead of World Toilet Day on 19 November.Titled, ‘Health, Safety and Dignity of Sanitation Workers: An Initial Assessment,’ the report highlights the value of sanitation work, and the health risks that sanitation workers experience in many developing countries, while providing society with an essential public health service. It presents nine case studies of sanitation workers in low- and middle-income countries, whose work involves emptying pits and tanks, transporting fecal sludge and performing sewer maintenance.The report finds that sanitation workers face high occupational health risks, weak legal protections, financial insecurity stemming from the informal and low-paid nature of their work, and social stigma. In Mumbai, India, for example, the authors cite an average of 25 sanitation worker deaths per month within a three-year period, a figure thought to be conservative in view of unreported incidents and other factors.The 46-page report urges governments and development partners to: reform policy, legislation and regulation around sanitation services; develop and adopt operational guidelines for workers; advocate for the human rights of sanitation workers and empower them to claim their rights; and strengthen evidence on the status of sanitation work. It provides examples of good practice, such as encouraging unionization, and providing healthcare services to sanitation workers.Maria Neira, WHO,notedthat sanitation workers make a key contribution to public health around the world, and stressed that “it is unacceptable” that they put their own health at risk to do so. Welcoming the report, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Léo Heller, called on governments to substantially increase the sanitation workforce and offer dignified and safe conditions, so as to meet their commitments under the 2030 Agenda to provide safely managed sanitation services (SDG indicator 6.2.1), as well as decent work for all (SDG target 8.5). Hecalledfor sanitation workers to be accorded “the social recognition they deserve and the safe and dignified working conditions they need,” including protection against infections, cuts and abrasions, and exposure to hazardous gases and chemicals.The UN marks World Toilet Day annually on 19 November. UN-Water coordinates the Day, which focused on the theme ‘Leaving No One Behind.’ A World Toilet Dayfact sheetwarns that the world is not on track to achieve SDG 6, as 4.2 billion people still live without safely managed sanitation – meaning the use of hygienic toilet facilities not shared with other households, separation of excreta from human contact, and safe disposal and treatment of excreta. Estimates suggest that, for every US$1 invested on basic sanitation, an average of US$2.50 is returned  in saved medical costs and increased productivity in urban areas, while US$5 is returned from rural areas. [UN-Water Report Web Page] [World Toilet Day]",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report summarizing activities and events that took place around the world as part of 2019 International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (ILPPW).Theseventh edition of the ILPPW, held from 20-26 October 2019, raised awareness and promoted actions to address the human health effects of lead exposure, especially in children. It sought to urge governments without legal limits on lead in paint to establish and implement limits, building on theModel Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint, which helps countries develop their own legally binding controls.ILPPW 7 also urged industry in countries where legal limits are not yet in place to voluntarily stop the manufacture, import, and sale of paint with lead, and civil society to engage with governments and industry to support the development and implementation of legislation. The week also focused on the Strategic Approach for International Chemicals Management (SAICM)-Global Environment Facility (GEF) project to increase the number of countries phasing out lead paint.The ILPPW was organized by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) through theGlobal Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance), a voluntary initiative to catalyze efforts to achieve international goals to prevent children’s exposure to lead from paint and to minimize occupational exposures to lead paint.Eighty-nine events were registered on the WHO website for the ILPPW by governments, NGOs, the paint industry, academia, and other event organizers. Events took place in Bangladesh, Georgia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, and Panama, among others.TheWHO reporton the Week describes demonstrations calling for action on lead paint, stakeholder meetings, educational activities in schools, social media communications, television and radio broadcasts, information stands in public areas, and calls for legislative action.The Lead Paint Alliance provided acampaign resource packagefocused on: increased awareness on risk and hazards of lead and lead paint; raising awareness and promoting action to prevent lead poisoning, particularly in children; and banning lead paint by working with national governments and stakeholders to establish laws to eliminate lead paint, and to ensure effective enforcement of lead paint regulations. Other resources include: a fact sheet that outlines steps to help countries adopt laws, an annual report describing the status of lead paint laws in countries as of September 2019, and an interactive map and database that provides information on the status of lead paint laws in countries, including regulations and controls.SDG Knowledge Hub coverage of chemicals of concern related to the SAICM/GEF project, including efforts to eliminate lead in paint, can be foundhere.

"A policy brief by the International Institute for Sustainable Development considers the impact of a 25-year-old global effort to reduce marine pollution from land-based sources. Such pollution “continues unabated,” but author Delia Paul finds that the experience of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities (GPA) shows the value of issue framing and coalition building, as well as creating space for practical action and experimentation.Land-based pollution includes untreated sewage, agricultural run-off, oils and heavy metals from industry, and sediment washed in from earthworks and logging. Covering nine categories altogether, land-based sources account for 80% of marine pollution. As a result of pollution, Paul writes, “oceans are no longer a limitless source of food, teeming with life. Nor are they bottomless trash bins.”In January 2019, UNEP and the GPA launched a five-year project to coordinate action around wastewater pollution, nutrient management, and marine litter, and engaged in partnerships in each area. Governments at theUN Environment Assemblylater that year agreed activities in each of these three areas should become part of UNEP’s regular programme of work.Despite these efforts, the discharge of nutrients and pollutants into marine environments has increased, resulting in more than 500 identified “dead zones” in the world’s oceans. Paul points to a few challenges in governing land-based sources of marine pollution. First, it has relied heavily on industry self-regulation and consumer action, which has focused only one some categories of pollution such as single-use plastics. And global governance responses have become more specialized over time, such as the Stockholm Convention focused on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the Minamata Convention focused on mercury.The GPA has managed to spark change, however, helping countries to adopt relevant policies and helping with “agenda setting” during negotiations on the SDGs, which now include target 14.1: “By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.” The GPA also has increased knowledge about land-based sources of marine pollution through conducting scientific assessments and publishing guidance for countries. Moreover, the GPA’s focus on partnerships has resulted in coalitions for action, whose work continues.IISD’s ‘Still Only One Earth’ policy briefs are being released in the lead-up to the 50th anniversaries of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and the UN Environment Program (UNEP), which will be marked in 2022. The briefs assess “successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy,” focusing onbiodiversity,wildlife trade,sustainable energy,finance and technology,climate change, andplastic pollution, among other issues.

"10 July 2019: Universities and other institutions from six continents have declared a climate emergency in a letter detailing a three-point plan to address the climate crisis ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in September. The letter is part of ‘The SDG Accord,’ the university and college sector’s collective response to the SDGs.The letter explains that young people must have the knowledge, skills and capacity to respond to the climate challenge, and outlines support for: mobilizing additional resources for climate change research and skills creation; committing to carbon neutrality by 2030 or 2050 at the latest; and increasing the delivery of environmental and sustainability education across curricula, campuses and community outreach programmes.The letter recognizes the need for a drastic societal shift to address the climate threat, and calls on governments and other education institutions to join in declaring a climate emergency and taking actions to address climate change.The letter, organized by The Alliance for Sustainability Leadership in Education (EAUC),Second Natureand the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP)Youth and Education Alliance, marks the first time higher education establishments have collectively committed to address the climate crisis. It was shared during a 10 July 2019 meeting of theHigher Education Sustainability Initiative, ahead of the UN Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019.The letter was signed by universities from,inter alia, Kenya, China, France, the UK, the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Mexico, and global education networks, such as the Global Alliance and theGlobally Responsible Leadership Initiative, which have committed to carbon neutrality. Currently, 87 institutions representing more than 1,360,000 students, and 34 networks representing more than 7,800 institutions have signed the letter.Examples of best practices for sustainability on college campuses include: Kenya’s Strathmore University, which runs on clean energy and has set up a 600 kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) grid tie system; Tongji University in China, which has invested in a sustainability education curriculum and is encouraging other education institutions to do the same; the University of California in the US, which has committed to a system-wide goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025; and American University and Colgate University in the US, both of which have already achieved carbon neutrality.The aim of the initiative is to get as many networks and institutions as possible on board to showcase commitments made towards achieving SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 13 (climate action). The hope is that over 10,000 institutions will sign the letter before the end of the 2019.EAUC represents over 200 institutions with a combined total of two million students, nearly 400,000 staff and a spending budget of over GBP 25 billion. Second Nature aims to accelerate climate action in and through higher education by mobilizing higher education institutions to scale campus climate initiatives and create innovative climate solutions.

"22 September 2019: On the eve of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, the 11th High-Level Assembly of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) to reduce Short-lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) discussed climate and clean air action needed on the ground and members’ ambition for further implementation.The 11th meeting of the CCAC High-Level Assembly took place in New York, US, on 22 September 2019, and was attended by high-level representatives of governments and international and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The CCAC is a voluntary international coalition of governments, international organizations, private sector representatives and NGOs, and aims to: reduce emissions of SLCPs; avoid millions of premature deaths; promote food and energy security; and address near-term climate change.On air pollution and health, speakers stressed the loss of lives and economic costs due to poor air quality, and how this can be a lever for enhanced and fast climate action. They also discussed progress in monitoring air quality and addressing SLCPs, and the need to evaluate the benefits of climate change action through a well-being lens.On cooling and efficiency, ministers reported on investments in efficient and climate-friendly refrigeration and cooling, highlighting the rising demand for cooling caused by climate change and growing cities. They drew attention to theBiarritz Pledgeinitiated at the G7 Summit and its call for support of the CCAC’s Efficient Cooling Initiative.On agriculture and food systems, participants reported on efforts to reduce methane and black carbon emissions, emphasizing the importance of raising awareness on agriculture climate solutions that balance the need for ensuring food security and poverty alleviation. They also noted the importance of healthy, low-carbon diets and of reducing food waste.Taking stock of the CCAC’s work launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit, representatives from the private sector described integrated solutions to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas industry. They highlighted private sector efforts to reduce climate and air pollutant emissions from freight, and called on countries to join a ‘Global Methane Alliance.’In the closing session, participants adopted the 2030 Vision Statement committing members to “drive and respond to scientific and political progress to maintain an atmosphere that enables people and the planet to thrive – a stabilized climate with warming limited to 1.5°C and drastically reduced air pollution.”Members agreed to add this statement to the CCAC Framework Document and to extend the duration of the Coalition’s mandate until the end of 2030. Several members pledged additional financial support to the Coalition’s work. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was welcomed as the CCAC’s newest CCAC state partner.

"10 September 2019: The World Bank has published a report that provides an overview of power sector reforms in developing countries since the 1990s, and underscores the importance of rethinking reforms in the sector going forward, based on 21st century policy objectives.The publication titled, ‘Rethinking Power Sector Reform in the Developing World,’ explains why some countries have made significant progress in providing reliable, affordable and sustainable electricity, while others have not fared so well. It notes that, since 1990, many countries have undertaken market-oriented power sector reforms, including establishing independent regulators, privatizing parts of the power industry, restructuring utilities and introducing competition. However, it states, only a few countries, mainly larger middle-income ones with minimum levels of power sector development and supportive political environments, have been able to fully implement these reforms. More often, countries selectively adopted some of the reforms, leading to a situation where market orientation coexisted with strong state participation in the power sector.The report explains that the “goal posts have moved” since the 1990s, when achieving energy security and fiscal sustainability was sufficient. However, it notes, more recently, countries have set their sights on more ambitious goals that involve social and environmental components such as achieving universal energy access and decarbonizing the electricity supply in line with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and the Paris Agreement on climate change, necessitating both market reforms and complementary policy measures to incentivize investments.Recent technological disruptions, the report argues, are leading to a more decentralized model, and innovation is transforming the sector’s landscape through renewable energy, battery storage and digitalized networks.The report describes three significant policy implications based on the study’s findings, namely: reform efforts must be shaped by the political and economic context of individual countries; reform efforts should be tailored towards achieving desired policy outcomes; and countries must be able to pursue multiple institutional pathways to achieve the desired outcomes.The report also finds that,inter alia:while the private sector has financed a substantial expansion of generation capacity, its contribution to power distribution has been more limited, and efficiency levels can sometimes be matched by well-governed public utilities;good corporate practices, particularly with respect to human resources and financial discipline, are associated with better utility performance and are more prevalent among private utilities; andcost recovery has been difficult to achieve and sustain, and any progress has been more the result of efficiency improvements rather than tariff hikes.The report looks at case studies from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Uganda, Ukraine and Viet Nam. The project was supported by the World Bank’s Energy and Extractives Global Practice, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and thePublic-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF).

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has revised trend projections in light of the latest statistics, charting world merchandise trade volume and related trade data. The Organization forecasts a 9.2% decline in the volume of world merchandise trade for 2020, followed by a 7.2% increase in 2021.The expected 2020 decline is less than the droppreviously projectedby the WTO in April, which forecast a 12.9% decrease even under an “optimistic scenario.”The WTO cautions however, that the projection is “subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty” due to dependence on the evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and governments’ responses. Further, the 2021 projection falls short of previously-projected growth, which was last forecast at 21.3%. This is in line with the WTO’s “weak recovery” expectation, rather than the more optimistic “quick return to trend” scenario.Whereas the WTO observes early signs of growth in trade merchandise and an exceeding of short-term projections, gross domestic product (GDP) fell more than expected in the first half of 2020. Projections for the year as a whole show a decline in world market-weighted GDP by 4.8% for 2020, compared to the expected drop of 2.5% released in April.The WTO examines several upside and downside risks associated with these forecasts. Major factors that could impact the projections include a resurgence of COVID-19 that triggers additional extended lockdowns, which would reduce global GDP and trade growth alike. However, a successful vaccine could buoy both trade volume and GDP, the WTO notes.By sector, the release shows how certain types of goods trade were impacted quarter-by-quarter, from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. The WTO tracked quarterly year-on-year growth in the USD value of three product groups: agricultural products; fuels and mining products; and manufactured goods. Whereas agricultural products show a marginal decline, fuel and mining products decline by 38% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to Q2 2019. Focusing on the second quarter of 2020, a month-by-month breakdown for specific manufactured goods industries is also available. AWTO designated webpagelists the economic support measures adopted by members in response to the pandemic.While global merchandise trade dropped precipitously in the second quarter of 2020, the release shows a distinct difference in the way regions were impacted. The sharpest declines – in both imports and exports – were observed in Europe and North America. Asia was not as strongly affected. Additional global data, on international commercial flights and other economic proxies, show a rebound, but “whether they retain their predictive power during the unusual COVID-19 pandemic remains to be seen.” [WTO Press Release] [WTO List of COVID-19 Support Measures]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"11 September 2014: On the sidelines of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), business executives and other stakeholders pledged to work towards more sustainable food and land use, including through an emphasis on soil health, value chain sustainability, and climate- and water-smart solutions.The ‘UNCCD Delhi Declaration from Business’ emerged from these consultations, which were held on 7 September during the UNCCD Business Day on Soil, Land and Agriculture. The Day was organized by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in partnership with the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and sponsored by Syngenta and Nutrien.The discussions included a focus on blended finance solutions and the role of “restoration entrepreneurs,” whose innovations to improve soil health and develop sustainable value chains could be supported at scale through closer public-private engagement. Addressing participants, UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw described land restoration as “very good business,” adding that every dollar invested generates between US$5 and US$30 and is “the cheapest way to remove carbon from the atmosphere.”The Declaration emphasizes the critical role of business in achieving a land-degradation neutral world and highlights six priorities for action.The Declaration emphasizes the critical role of business in achieving a land-degradation neutral world and highlights six priorities for action to enhance: sustainable land management (SLM) solutions for agriculture, food, forestry, shelter and energy; scaled up solutions through value chain and landscape-based approaches such as deforestation-risk commodities; resilience of communities through improved livelihood opportunities and food security; climate-smart approaches to agriculture; biodiversity, including crop and dietary diversity; and “robust business decision-making and progress” through science-based targets, risk management, reporting, and environmental, social and governance processes.Presenting the Declaration to COP 14 delegates for adoption, business representatives underscored the role of government in driving “a new deal for nature and people” and highlighted some policy shifts required to leverage the contribution of the private sector, including: developing clear policies and targets; harmonizing decision making within the UN framework; harnessing the role of market-based mechanisms; and supporting resilient local livelihoods through,inter alia, entrepreneurship and climate adaptation measures, and land tenure security.A core objective of COP 14, which convened under the overarching theme of ‘Restore Land to Sustain Life,’ was to build a global “movement” to scale up land restoration. The role of diverse stakeholders is recognized in the final COP 14 ministerial outcome, ‘The New Delhi Declaration: Investing in Land and Unlocking Opportunities,’ that was endorsed by ministers and other country representatives. The official declaration pledges Parties’ support for new initiatives or coalitions aiming to improve human health and well-being, as well as the health of ecosystems, and to advance peace and security.The UNCCD SLM Business Forum was inaugurated at COP 11, held in Windhoek, Namibia, in October 2013.

"11 October 2019: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) has released a series of publications on migration and displacement, which argue that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should remain the foundation on which UNDP structures its support to countries and communities on migration and displacement. The publications present UNDP’s “offer” on migration and displacement, including within the context of sustainable development and the SDGs.UNDP’s migration and displacement approach focuses on: eradicating poverty and keeping people out of poverty (SDG 1); accelerating structural transformations for sustainable development, particularly through innovative solutions that have multiplier effects across the SDGs; and building resilience to crises and shocks to safeguard development gains. In the series of publications, UNDP highlights ways that it: addresses the root causes of displacement and drivers of migration; supports governments to integrate migration and development issues in national and local development plans, particularly for the localization of SDGs; supports refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities to cope, recover and sustain development gains in crisis and post crisis; and supports governments to create an environment for voluntary return and community-based re/integration. Throughout the publications, UNDP underscores the contributions of this work to progress on leaving no one behind and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities).In the report titled, ‘Promoting Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement,’ UNDP maps specific SDGs to UNDP’s Migration and Displacement Policy and Programming. For example, linking SDG 15 (life on land) to root causes of migration and displacement, the report highlights efforts to address displacement or migration due to desertification and land degradation, and increase migrant/diaspora investment into initiatives addressing land degradation, as possible relevant policy and programme activities. This example also demonstrates ways to mainstream positive contributions of migrants/diaspora.A publication titled, ‘Safe, Regular, Orderly Migration,’ presents UNDP’s corporate position on the Global Compact for Migration, and describes UNDP’s role in supporting Member States to deliver on the Compact. UNDP has committed to mainstream migration and displacement into national development plans and SDG implementation, and to analyze and address root causes of displacement and drivers of migration. An Annex maps the objectives of the Compact against the SDGs.The report titled, ‘Key Achievements, Experiences and Lessons Learned,’ showcases UNDP accomplishments and lessons learned on migration and displacement between 2016 and 2018. The report stresses that solutions to migration and displacements are “intrinsically linked to the achievement of the SDGs,” particularly specific SDG targets related to migration, and recommends the international community design and implement projects with a clear contribution to achieving the SDGs at national and local levels. The report states that, in countries where this link is made, governments and the international community “have seen the importance of migration and displacement solutions programmes to sustainable development.” [Publication:Promoting Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement] [Publication:Safe, Regular, Orderly Migration] [Publication:Key Achievements, Experiences and Lessons Learned]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

"Five organizations that set global standards for sustainability reporting have announced that they will work together to create a single set of reporting standards. This approach is intended to help stakeholders base decisions on comparable information and reduce the burden on reporting companies.In a statement launched on 11 September 2020, CDP, the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) said the urgency for reporting coherence is driven by “the increasingly clear connection between sustainability performance and financial risk and return,” as well as climate change and the global pandemic. The organizations cite a groundswell of stakeholder support for a comprehensive reporting system.Sustainability disclosures enable stakeholders to understand a company’s impacts on society and the environment, and how these issues affect the organization’s financial performance and long-term enterprise value creation. The groups note the need for corporate sustainability data to be structured around agreed taxonomies and available in a public platform.SDG target 12.6 commits governments to “Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.” The global indicator (12.6.1) is “Number of companies publishing sustainability reports.”Previous efforts to improve corporate reporting on sustainable practices include atoolkitlaunched by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 2019, aiming to improve coherence between financial and sustainability reporting. UNCTAD noted that the diversity of reporting frameworks has presented a challenge for government agencies and investors interested in monitoring SDG implementation at the national level.Harmonized sustainability reporting could help governments incorporate the private sector’s contributions to SDG implementation into voluntary national reviews (VNRs).In April 2020, GRI issuedsuggestions for governmentsto capture business action on the SDGs in their VNRs through the use of corporate reporting. GRI stressed that capturing the contribution of the private sector is necessary for understanding what actions are needed and who can take them in order to achieve the SDG targets in each country.

"The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has publisheda report that finds extreme weather events, particularly climate-related disasters, have increased sharply over the last twenty years, resulting in more than a million deaths and nearly USD 3 trillion in economic losses.The report titled, ‘The Human Cost of Disasters: An Overview of the Last 20 Years: 2000-2019,’ was issued on 13 October – the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The report serves as a reminder to countries of their commitments under theSendai Framework, to enact national and local DRR strategies by 2020, and highlights the urgency of taking action on climate change.The report finds that 7,348 major disaster events occurred between 2000-2019, killing 1.23 million and affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), and resulting in USD 2.97 trillion in economic losses. This represents an increase over the previous twenty-year period, during which 4,212 natural disasters killed 1.19 million and affected 3.25 billion people and caused USD 1.63 trillion in economic losses. A significant portion of the increase was driven by a rise in climate-related disasters, like extreme weather events such as floods and storms, which nearly doubled from 3,656 to 6,681. Shifting rainfall patterns and greater precipitation variability also contribute to the increase by placing the 70% of global agriculture that is rain fed, and 1.3 billion people dependent on it, at significant risk.Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century.The report recommends that countries improve disaster risk governance by strengthening vision, plans, guidelines, funding, and cross-sectoral coordination. While the report credits improvements to early warning systems and disaster preparedness and response for “a reduction in loss of life in single-hazard scenarios,” it highlights the “increasingly systemic nature of disaster risk.” Events’ overlap and interplay with other risk drivers, including poverty, climate change, population growth in hazard-exposed areas, uncontrolled urbanization, and biodiversity loss, expose the need to further strengthen disaster risk governance, the report notes. The report warns that inability to understand and manage systemic risk jeopardizes the achievement of the Sendai Framework and the SDGs.To mark the International Day, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for DRR Mami Mizutori also held a public online conversation. The two agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote coherence between DRR and climate change adaptation in national strategies for DRR and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).Espinosa stressed the need to enhance “efforts to address climate change and help build resilience to it.”Mizutori called for “an integrated approach which recognizes the increasingly systemic nature of risk and how climate interacts with other drivers of risk.” “Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century,” she said.

"The co-facilitators for the declaration on the UN’s 75th anniversary have circulated a revised draft for Member States’ consideration. The revision makes several changes in the section containing 12 commitments to action, including new references to human rights, terrorism, and sustainable financing.Co-facilitators Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden, shared the revision on 5 June 2020. They noted that the text incorporates input provided by Member States during virtual consultations on 22 May 2020 and in subsequent written comments.In the list of actions, instead of “we will work to ensure peace and security,” the commitment reads, “we will promote peace and prevent conflicts.” The paragraph notes the need to respect rules governing the use of force, and it identifies terrorism as one of the most critical threats to international peace and security.Instead of “we will abide by international rules and norms,” the revision commits Member States to “abide by international law and ensure justice.” It specifies that countries will not abide not only by their international agreements but also by the commitments they have made. It also adds a reference to promoting respect for human rights.A commitment to ensure financing has been changed to ensuring “sustainable financing,” and the paragraph commits leaders to enhancing transparency, accountability and efficient use of resources.Delegations were expected to hold a consultation to discuss the revised text on 8 June 2020. [Revised zero draft]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"In their latest report on trade developments in the region, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) highlight that non-tariff measures (NTMs) play an increasingly important role in regulating trade, and can help achieve the SDGs. NTMs include measures such as quotas, phytosanitary measures and environmental standards.The biannualreporttitled, ‘Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2019: Navigating Non-Tariff Measures Toward Sustainable Development,’ maps existing NTMs in Asia-Pacific against each SDG, finding that many NTMs relate to health (SDG 3) and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), while other aspects of sustainable development are neglected. For example, very few NTMs in the region address illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing (covered by SDG 14) and illegal timber trade (part of SDG 15).The authors note that some NTMs are thought to have indirect or unintended benefits for sustainable development. For example, NTMs imposing restrictions on the sale of alcohol may have positive impacts on gender equality (SDG 5) by reducing violence against women (SDG target 5.2).Asia-Pacific countries have increased their use of NTMs have by 15% each year, as developing countries “catch up” to apply standards that are already prevalent in more developed economies. However, many countries lack the necessary infrastructure, such as testing laboratories, to assess conformity with regulations. The authors recommend building capacity and expertise in developing countries to strengthen local capacity and promote developing countries’  participation in international standard setting, to ensure that international standards benefit them and are relevant to their needs.They further recommend that countries conduct detailed sustainability impact assessments on the impacts of NTMs at the country and sector levels, and propose developing regional guidelines on sustainability impact assessment of NTMs.While NTMs increase the costs of trade, the report emphasizes that NTMs “are neither good nor bad,” and sets out good practices in applying NTMs. [Publication:Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2019: Navigating Non-Tariff Measures Toward Sustainable Development] [Report conclusions]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0

"17 September 2019: A UN report highlights future e-waste scenarios to address one of the world’s fastest growing solid waste streams, which has grown from 20 million to 50 million tonnes per year since 2000.The report titled, ‘Future E-waste Scenarios,’ explains that, under a baseline scenario, the amount of e-waste will more than double by 2050 to approximately 111 million tonnes per year. The report was published by the UN University (UNU)-hosted Solving the E-waste Problem (StEP) Initiative and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).The publication emphasizes the importance of the ways in which industries, policies and consumers are reacting, explains that creating sustainable production and consumption systems for electronics cannot be achieved under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, and calls for a drastic change in the electronics sector to meet the growing demand and address technological evolution, which is often unpredictable.The generation of e-waste for rapidly growing economies is expected to increase.While new technologies are advancing energy efficiency, the report explains that no economic incentive exists for recycling materials from e-waste. E-waste collection rates are only at around 20%, and most of e-waste is not properly treated.The report details three scenarios related to the future of e-waste:The BAU “linear growth” scenario, which involves increased electronics innovation, production and consumption, might result in less expensive products in the short term, but long-term costs will include environmental footprints, toxicity, and short-lived, single-use and disposable electronic products.Under the “reactive approach” scenario, where industry will have to comply with stricter regulations, the e-waste situation may improve locally but its impact will be outsourced to countries with weaker environmental regulations, and informal activities and compliance costs may be transferred to consumers.A “proactive path” is the best alternative, according to the report, under which industry will take the lead towards more sustainable production and consumption through, for example: manufacturers using innovative business models that prioritize lifetime extension and recycling of electronic products; and more circular business practices that help prevent e-waste generation.The report warns that electronics use and the resulting generation of e-waste is expected to increase, especially for rapidly growing economies that have not yet been overwhelmed by “the myriad of e-products that come with economic prosperity.” All stakeholders, the report argues, including producers, users, e-waste collectors, recyclers and policymakers, will have to take significant action to ensure a sustainable production and consumption system for e-products.TheStEP Initiativeis a network of e-waste experts and a multi-stakeholder platform for designing strategies that address all dimensions of electronics in an increasingly digitized world. It applies an integrated and science-rooted approach to create salient solutions to global e-waste challenges throughout the entire life cycle of electronics.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on governments everywhere to tackle non-communicable diseases (NCDs), emphasizing that people with NCDs are “among the most likely to become severely ill and die” from COVID-19. In other NCD news, a July 2020 ECOSOC resolution outlined Member States’ requests to the UN Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs.The four most common NCDs are cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. According to the WHO, NCDs account for seven in ten deaths worldwide, and people with NCDs have risk factors that make them increasingly vulnerable to “COVID-19, infection, and the likelihood of worse outcomes.” Studies from several countries have highlighted that individuals with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to be among those with COVID-19 fatalities. A recent study found that coronavirus-related disruptions in healthcare treatments have impacted people with NCDs; among those with cancer, for example, 55% of people have experienced disrupted health services.In his briefing on 4 September, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO is “encouraged by the progress we have made against this new virus.” He said national unity and global solidarity can help to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Tedros thanked countries and economies engaged in efforts to develop and produce a coronavirus vaccine and ensure its equitable distribution, noting that 78 high and medium-performing economies have pledged to support the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator project.In July 2020, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a resolution on prevention and control of NCDs, titled ‘Coordination, programme and other questions: prevention and control of non-communicable diseases’ (E/RES/2020/22). By the text, the Council:recognizes that “many countries still face significant challenges” in implementing commitments related to NCDs and that the human and economic cost of NCDs “contributes to poverty and inequities”;calls on the UN Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs to continue to work to support Member States in line with its strategy for 2019-2021, paying particular attention to Member States’ needs during COVID-19 response and recovery;requests the Task Force to further support Member States in their efforts to address the burden of NCDs, including through: maintaining essential health care services and their timely delivery; promoting access to safe, effective, quality and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics, essential medicines, vaccines and other health technologies; and strengthening health systems and supply chain management;requests the Task Force to strengthen its capacity to provide technical and policy advice to governments; andand requests the UN Secretary-General to report on progress achieved at ECOSOC’s 2021 session.[WHO Director-General statement] [UN News story on WHO statement] [ECOSOC Resolution on NCDs (E/RES/2020/22)]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"10 July 2019: A side event convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the sidelines of the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) raised awareness of the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (GAP) as an instrument to support countries to strengthen their healthcare systems and accelerate the achievement of health-related targets under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The GAP will be launched during this year’s UN General Assembly, helping to create a strong link to the High-level meeting on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the SDG Summit, also taking place in September 2019.The side event, ‘Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All: A Commitment to Accelerating Together,’ provided an opportunity for Member States and other stakeholders to learn more about the GAP, while providing feedback and showcasing how acceleration towards the health-related SDG targets can be achieved through coordinated and multisectoral actions. Introducing the GAP initiative, Stewart Simonson, Assistant Director-General, WHO’s office at the UN in New York, US, noted that at current rates of implementation, many countries will not achieve some crucial targets under SDG 3 (good health and well-being), including on HIV, maternal mortality rates, and tuberculosis.The discussions identified a number of areas for action, including: strengthening sustainable financing and primary health care; improving women’s quality of life through access to sexual reproductive services and equitable gender norms; and addressing environmental determinants such as air pollution, which is linked to the premature deaths of seven million people each year.During a panel discussion on interlinkages with other global goals, participants highlighted the need for empowering communities to lead SDG implementation, such as in the case of HIV response. It was noted that the GAP provides an opportunity for international agencies to achieve greater synergies in their support of local action and ensure a coherent approach to addressing cross-cutting issues such as gender equality (SDG 5) and climate action (SDG 13), as well as scaling up health investments.The debate highlighted that the GAP is not a Member State-negotiated document, and called for greater engagement of multiple stakeholders, in particular the private sector. Interested countries and stakeholders were invited to develop and implement their own country-specific acceleration approaches in time for the first planned stocktaking milestone in 2023.The GAP is a WHO-led initiative to unite organizations and key stakeholders to respond to health challenge in a holistic manner. Organized around three strategic approaches, “Align, Accelerate and Account,” the GAP seeks to reduce inefficiencies through, for example, harmonizing financing and procurement and strengthening the provision of essential global public goods for health. The GAP initiative was developed in response to a request from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of Ghana and Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, with support from UN Secretary-General António Guterres.IISD Reporting Services is providing coverage ofselected side eventsduring the 2019 HLPF.

He outlined direct and indirect effects of digital technologies on climate change, noting that direct energy use and emissions from digital technologies have been flat over the past decade. Kamiya noted the complexity of the effects of digitalization on sectors, and stressed the need for strong climate policies to ensure digital technologies are applied to reduce emissions. He emphasized the critical role of innovation to decarbonize long-distance transport.Joby Carlson, Director, Strategic Initiatives, Walmart, explained the company’s sustainability strategy, which includes a path to zero emissions by 2040, 100% renewable energy by 2035, and avoiding 1 gigaton (Gt) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across supply chains by 2030. He highlightedfour waysin which omnichannel retailers can reduce emissions: a) encouraging in-store pickup; b) minimizing total customer travel; c) reducing dedicated customer trips; and d) shipping from local stores.Kate Karn, Public Policy Manager, Mastercard, explained some of the company’s sustainability actions, such as an initiative to give Mastercard issuers the possibility to enable cardholders to monitor the carbon footprint of their purchases. Among trade policy priorities, she highlighted new rules on digital trade, in particular free flow of data and the elimination of data localization requirements, as well as an agreement on environmental goods.From a development perspective, Alice Tipping, Lead, Fisheries, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), highlighted considerations around trade policy decisions that developing countries may face in terms of importing or domestically producing goods, services, and technology for renewable energy. She said carbon labeling may pose challenges to developing countries, and stressed the need for coherence and inclusiveness in the development ofvoluntary sustainability standards(VSS).

It notes that SDG reviews “have not only taken root at the national level but are now also being promoted much more actively at the subnational and regional level.” The diversity of stakeholders engaged in the reviews has also increased, with actors including supreme audit institutions (SAIs), parliaments, the media, foundations and grassroots civil society groups.Key lessons identified in the report include:high-level political commitment is crucial;the 2030 Agenda helps overcome silos and foster policy coherence;working through umbrella organisations is an effective way to reach out to stakeholders;different actors have different roles, and it is important to clarify and communicate them;stakeholder involvement supports continuity; andthe demand for peer learning is increasing.The report provides case studies on topics ranging from “Colombia: Follow-up and lessons learned from repeated VNRs” to “The Philippines: Using citizen-generated data for SDG review and follow-up.” It explores the role of various actors in chapters on “Cameroon: Civil society spotlight report”, “UNESCAP: Role and experiences of a UN regional commission in supporting VNR processes”, and “Brazil: The evolving role of supreme audit institutions in SDG reviews.” Regional and local level reviews are discussed in chapters on “Oaxaca, Mexico: SDG review at state level” and “Bristol, United Kingdom: Voluntary Local Review – Connecting the SDGs with local realities.” Additional chapters address: “Afghanistan: SDG review in a fragile context”; “Mongolia: Enhancing policy coherence”; and “Viet Nam: Developing and harmonising indicator systems.”Partners for Review (P4R) is a transnational multi-stakeholder network that brings together representatives from governments, civil society, the private sector, academia, and other stakeholder groups to collaborate on topics related to the national review and follow-up of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Children’s playgrounds in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines and Thailand commonly contain painted equipment with lead levels above 90 ppm, the recommended limit by UN Environment Program (UNEP). Organizations in each country studied playground equipment as part of their participation in the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a group of NGOs working to prevent toxic chemicals from harming human health and the environment.Even more dangerous for children’s health, playgrounds in three of those countries – Malaysia, Mexico and the Philippines – contain levels of lead exceeding 100,000 ppm, and in Thailand, playgrounds were found with lead levels exceeding 10,000 ppm. Yellow-painted equipment and red monkey bars had the highest levels detected.IPEN announced the findings duringInternational Lead Poisoning Prevention Weekin October 2019, and noted the need for strong bans on lead paint that would include all types of paint, not only decorative.Manny Calonzo, IPEN Advisor, explained that “coatings on equipment inevitably flake and chip from weathering and regular wear and tear, become mixed in the sand and dirt, and put children at risk of life-long impairment from ingestion through normal hand to mouth behavior.” IPEN notes that safe and affordable alternatives to lead additives are widely available, and paint companies can obtain third-party certification throughLead Safe Paint.Sara Brosché, IPEN, adds that “leaded industrial paint for outdoor equipment and streets contain some of the highest levels of lead and are serious and preventable health threats to children….  Governments must act now to adopt strong regulatory controls to ban lead paint and improve life chances of children in their countries.”IPEN’s global lead paint elimination campaign is working with the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Environment Program (UNEP) and other partners in the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint.

"The World Bank has issued a five-year Sustainable Development Bond to raise awareness on the roles fresh and saltwater resources play in supporting livelihoods and planetary health. All World Bank bonds contribute to the financing of programmes that support the SDGs and aim to raise awareness of the private sector in financing sustainable development.The bond forms the collateral for a ‘Low Carbon Blue Economy Note,’ which Credit Suisse then offered to its private wealth management clients globally. Credit Suisse Securities acted as the sole manager of the transaction.Ocean health is “significantly underfunded from a private capital perspective.”Credit Suisse’s CEO of the Impact Advisory and Finance Department, Marisa Drew, stressed the importance of the world’s oceans in absorbing carbon dioxide and generating oxygen but recognized that ocean health is “significantly underfunded from a private capital perspective.” Drew said the Sustainable Development Bond  funding will help support projects on sustainable fisheries, marine protected areas and ocean waste upcycling and help “close the funding gap” on SDG 14 (life below water).The bond, issued for US$28.6 million, will also help focus attention on the role of water conservation and sustainable ocean use in sustainable development.

"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has published a briefing note on the role of trade in moving to a more circular economy for the electronics industry.The white paper titled, ‘Facilitating Trade Along Circular Electronics Value Chains,’ published on 18 September 2020, looks at trade-related challenges to reverse supply chains for circular electronics, emphasizing that it is possible to use technology to improve lives while limiting harmful improper and unnecessary disposal. The authors explore trade policy solutions, including international agreement between governments, bilateral regulatory pilot projects, and public‑private initiatives.The role that electronics play in economies and societies has become even more critical during the COVID‑19 pandemic, as they have allowed many types of work to continue by connecting workers. However, many electronics still end up in the environment or are recycled in an unsafe manner. The 2020 issue of the UN’sGlobal E‑Waste Monitorfinds that, in 2019, 53.6 million metric tonnes of electronic waste were generated, with around 82% likely not collected and managed in an environmentally sound manner.Challenges highlighted in the briefing note relate to: complexities of product classifications; factors leading to increases in reverse logistic costs for used products and those characterized as hazardous; and cumbersome trade‑permitting processes, particularly for products classified as hazardous. For example, reverse logistics for used electronic products were reportedly 31% more costly than outbound logistics for new products, and delays of up to 14 months for completing paperwork on hazardous products are common.Describing solutions or potential trade facilitation actions, the paper highlights border and internal measures, transparency on domestic requirements for waste classification and movement, and policy actions including international trade instruments and regulatory cooperation between countries. For example, when electronic products are classified as hazardous under the Basel Convention, or domestically, they can face trade bans and, if transboundary movement is permitted, are subject to prior informed consent (PIC) from the import and transit countries.The Convention’s focus on risky trade could be complemented by measures to facilitate responsible trade for the circular economy. For example, trade facilitation capacity building could help digitalize and automate the PIC procedure, and regulatory cooperation could involve fast-track systems for permits or longer validity periods.The paper is part of a series on trade and the circular economy. A July 2020 paper in the series considers cross‑border issues in the circular economy and plastic pollution.The briefing note is expected to contribute to a broader report on circular electronics pathways, to be released in January 2021. [Publication:Facilitating Trade Along Circular Electronics Value Chains]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"9 July 2019: The first in-depth review of progress toward SDG 4 (quality education) took place on the opening day of the 2019 HLPF session. UNICEF head Henrietta Fore said no country can afford to have one in every three children out of school, as is currently the case in low- and lower-middle-income countries. She called for investing in what works, such as girls’ education, early childhood interventions, and reaching those left behind, such as children living through conflicts, refugees and migrants, and rural settings or urban slums.As reported by theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, lead discussant Susan Hopgood, Education International, said the world is “severely off track” to achieve SDG 4. Shashwat Sapkota, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), described a “global learning crisis,” with a low proficiency rate among schoolchildren in reading and mathematics despite increased enrollment rates, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.Hopgood suggested supporting teachers, a message echoed by panelist Kazuhiro Yoshida, Co-Chair, SDG-Education 2030 Steering Committee, who called for a system of support for teachers to create an enabling environment for learning. Morocco reported that all public school teachers in her country have secure public service contracts.Hopgood also stressed the need to recognize education as a public good, not a commodity. Otherwise, we can never achieve equitable systems, she explained. Similarly, another lead discussant Madeleine Zúñiga, Global Campaign for Education, cautioned that private education may further exacerbate inequality, and she stressed the importance of addressing diversity to increase the quality of education.Panelist John McLaughlin, Deputy Minister, Education and Early Childhood Development, Canada, identified gender as a central focus for education. Sweden highlighted the importance of education to advance gender equality and reduce gender violence.Persons with Disabilities called for system changes, such as universal design approaches, that facilitate access to education. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Intersex stakeholders stressed the importance of lifelong learning and a commitment to local and indigenous languages for inclusive learning environments. Indigenous Peoples said culturally sensitive information should be included in core curricula of schools. Children and Youth called for education that enables adaptation to climate change.Among other input from Member States, Argentina reported on the Group of Friends for Education and Lifelong Learning, launched by Permanent Representatives to the UN on the International Day of Education on 24 January 2019, to advocate for achieving SDG 4 globally. The Republic of Korea observed that SDG 4 does not receive the attention it deserves at UN Headquarters. The EU mentioned the role of the aid effectiveness principles in advancing progress on SDG 4.Countries also linked education to the achievement of other SDGs. Algeria highlighted the importance of SDG 4 to achieving SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), while Mexico highlighted the importance of vocational training for achieving SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth).The July 2019 session of the HLPF will also hold in-depth reviews of progress on SDG 8, SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

"IUCN has launched the first-everGlobal Standard for Nature-based Solutions. The Standard guides users through Nature-based Solutions (NbS) applications and sets benchmarks for their progress.Launchedon 23 July 2020, the IUCN Global Standard for NbS consists of eight criteria and associated indicators that address considerations related to biodiversity, economy, and society, as well as resilient project management. IUCN has indicated that a governing body of the Standard will revise the criteria every four years.The Standard is accompanied by guidance that instructs users in performing self-assessments to design new NbS, scale up pilots by identifying gaps, and verify past projects and future proposals. The assessment results in a percentage match with good practices, with a “traffic light” system to identify areas for further work and adherence to the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions.During the2016 World Conservation Congressand members’ assembly, IUCN’s members adopted a resolution that defined NbS as: “actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits.” IUCN reports that there have been cases of misuse of the NbS concept, with worst-case scenarios damaging and eroding biodiversity. Therefore, the Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions, building on the agreed definition, provides parameters for defining NbS and a common framework from which to work.In 2019, the UN established nine coalitions – including one on nature-based solutions – in preparation for theClimate Action Summitin September 2019. One year later, UN Member States will consider NbS among other issues during theSummit on Biodiversity.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Since March 2019 and through 25 Sustainable Development Bonds in ten currencies, the World Bank has issued the equivalent of USD 2 billion in support for SDG target 12.3, which calls for halving food waste and reducing food loss by 2030.The first sustainable development bond designed to raise awareness of food loss and waste was issued with the Folksam Group. Since then, the Bank has engaged with other investors. A variety of banks, asset managers, insurance companies and pension funds have shown their support, especially in Japan where investors accounted for almost 80% of the transaction volume thus far, including Norinchukin Bank, which invested a total of approximately USD 1.2 billion.Yoshiyuki Arima, Japan Representative of the World Bank Treasury, explained that the “swift and steady” demand from investors to raise awareness of food loss and waste demonstrates the role that the capital markets and private sector partners can play in supporting solutions through their own assets and operations.The bonds support the financing of sustainable development projects and programs in member countries, including USD 4.6 billion in lending that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) provides to middle income countries to address food loss and waste, with investments in infrastructure, access to markets and logistics, and waste management.The World Bank sustainable development bonds, with annual issuances between USD 50-60 billion, support the SDGs through financing of programs that contribute to the achievement of the Goals.

"Ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26), a facility has been launched to help developing countries incorporate energy-efficient, climate-friendly cooling programmes into the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).The NDC Support Facility for Efficient, Climate-Friendly Cooling was launched on 27 January 2020, by the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program (K-CEP), a philanthropic initiative to support the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol, with a focus on the energy efficiency of cooling. The new Facility will advance cooling solutions in a way that complements the Kigali Amendment, which aims to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).The K-CEP press release explains that the demand for cooling is expected to rise dramatically with the anticipated rise in global temperatures, and the global energy demand for air conditioning will triple by 2050. More efficient, climate-friendly options for cooling are needed; otherwise, K-CEP says, “the emissions from cooling could use up most of the remaining carbon budget required to achieve the Paris target of staying below a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures within the next few decades.”The NDC Support Facility plans to award up to USD 12 million to organizations to provide technical assistance and other support to eligible Article 5 countries (including Kigali Amendment Group 2 countries such as India) that are making new cooling commitments in their strengthened NDCs for COP 26. Up to USD 5 million of this total is earmarked for proposals requesting technical assistance for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to improve the energy efficiency of air-conditioning equipment, and USD 3.2 million will be dedicated to helping communities that are most at risk from a lack of access to cooling.

"3 July 2019: The Fifth Pacific Urban Forum called for accelerating implementation of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) to achieve the SDGs in the Pacific region. The Forum agreed on an action plan that focuses on four areas: social equity; environment, resilience and urbanization; urban economy; and urban governance.Fiji’s Prime Minister, Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, described sustainable urban development as a tool to tackle climate vulnerability and inequality. He emphasized that “the boldness of our decisions and the strength of our cooperation” will determine whether urban centers become engines of sustainable development or “bastions of inequity and climate vulnerability.”In her remarks, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) Secretary General Meg Taylor highlighted the importance of a regional approach to urbanization. She emphasized that urbanization “can become a powerful force for the sustainable development of our Pacific countries” if the Pacific acts with foresight and gets “our responses to these challenges right.”The boldness of our decisions will determine whether urban centers become engines of sustainable development or bastions of inequity and climate vulnerability.Participants recognized the role of urbanization in achieving sustainable development, and highlighted the role of long-term national planning for urbanization through national sustainable development plans and urban policies. The Forum reviewed the Pacific New Urban Agenda in light of the SDGs, and discussed how to anchor the Pacific New Urban Agenda within the region’s institutional and political architecture. Participants also considered how the region’s land tenure and informal settlements affect urbanization, and called for policies to develop healthy, safe, liveable cities.Incoming PIFS Chairman, Prime Minister of Tuvalu Enele Sosana Sopoaga, committed to support the Pacific New Urban Agenda during closing remarks. He said he will support the Pacific New Urban Agenda at the PIFS and at global forums, including the Seventh Asia Pacific Forum and the tenth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF).The UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the Government of Fiji co-hosted the Fifth Pacific Urban Forum, which convened in Nadi, Fiji, from 1-3 July 2019.

"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has published a report warning that over half of the global gross domestic product (GDP) is potentially threatened by nature loss. The report argues that 15 systemic transitions across three socioeconomic systems could create annual business opportunities worth USD 10 trillion and 395 million jobs by 2030.The report titled, ‘The Future of Nature and Business,’ states that there is “no future for business as usual.” It finds that while fighting climate change is essential, it is “not enough,” and “a fundamental transformation” is needed across the socioeconomic systems of: food, land, and ocean use; infrastructure and the built environment; and extractives and energy. These systems, the report notes, represent over a third of the global economy and provide up to two-thirds of all jobs. They also drive the threats which endanger almost 80% of the total threatened and near-threatened species.Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic is a “stark reminder” that ignoring biophysical risks can have “catastrophic health and economic impacts at the global scale,” the report calls for recovery efforts to address the planetary crises of climate change and nature loss in a way that would “build back better” and avoid “an unsustainable and dangerous business-as-usual approach.”The report identifies 15 systemic transitions that can “pave the way towards a people- and nature-positive development that will be resilient to future shocks.” It notes, however, that USD 2.7 trillion per year through to 2030 will be needed to scale the transitions, including deployment of the technological innovation critical to 80% of the business opportunity value identified in the report.The publication, prepared in collaboration withAlphaBeta, is the second of three reports in the WEF’s New Nature Economy series. Its findings inform the working priorities of theChampions for Nature, a community of leaders working towards a nature-positive global economy, and feed into aPolicy Companionreport which helps governments ensure that nature is integrated into economies to deliver “high-quality jobs and new sources of economic value, while preserving the natural capital needed for public health and societal resilience.”The New Nature Economy series aims to contribute to the15th meetingof the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) by making the case for whythe nature crisis is crucial to business and the economy, identifying a set of priority socioeconomic systems for transformation, and scoping the market and investment opportunities for nature-based solutions to environmental challenges.

They plan to convene a virtual consultation to discuss the draft on 22 May. That meeting will include a briefing from the UN Secretary-General’s Special Advisor on preparations for UN75.We will place women and girls at the center.The introduction to the draft declaration describes the need for a strong UN and notes that the UN presently faces “the largest global challenge in its history,” referring to the COVID-19 pandemic. It recalls that the UN was established to save future generations, and it has had many achievements: “Every day, countries, citizens, private sector and civic actors use the platform provided by the United Nations to make life better” for humanity and the planet. However, the introduction continues, the UN also has “had its moments of disappointment,” which points to the need for greater action.The UN75 Global Conversation initiated by the UN Secretary-General in late 2019 has elicited people’s concerns and aspirations, the text notes; the UN Member States “are here to respond.” The introduction also underlines that the pandemic shows that “we are only as strong as our weakest link,” and that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity and in every country’s national interest.The declaration then sets out twelve statements of commitment, which the co-facilitators indicate respond to views expressed by people around the world through the UN75 global conversation:We will leave no one behind;We will protect our planet;We will work to ensure peace and security;We will abide by international rules and norms;We will place women and girls at the center;We will build trust;We will promote the use of new technologies for the benefit of all;We will upgrade the United Nations;We will ensure financing;We will boost partnerships;We will listen to and work with youth; andWe will be prepared.The draft concludes that “what we agree today will affect the sustainability of our planet” and the welfare of future generations. By the text, leaders would request the Secretary-General to provide recommendations on advancing the common agenda before the end of the UN General Assembly’s 75th session (2020-2021). [Letter from co-facilitators containing zero draft of declaration] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on elements paper for declaration] [Summary of initial findings from UN75 Global Conversation]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"India and South Africa circulated a communication to members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) General Council, arguing that the WTO moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions has “catastrophic” impacts on developing countries’ economic growth, jobs, and the attainment of the SDGs. In another communication, a group of WTO members highlighted “the overall benefits” of duty-free electronic transmissions.The WTO e-commerce moratorium, which bans countries from imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions, dates back to 1998 when ministers at the Second Ministerial Conference adopted theDeclaration on Global Electronic Commerce, calling for the establishment of a work programme on e-commerce, which was adopted later that year. Since then, at every Ministerial Conference, WTO membershave agreed“to maintain the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions.”The WTOWork Programme on Electronic Commercedefines “electronic commerce” as the “production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.” According to arecent WTO report, the enforcement of social distancing, lockdowns, and other measures to address the COVID‑19 pandemic resulted in anuptake in e-commerce, including online sales and streaming of videos and films.In March 2020,India and South Africacirculated a communication, outlining the implications the moratorium has on developing countries, including: tariff revenue losses; impacts on industrialization; impacts on the use of digital technologies like 3D printing in manufacturing; as well as losses of other duties and charges. The countries argue that the moratorium is “equivalent to developing countries giving the digitally advanced countries duty-free access to [their] markets.”According to a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)article, in 2017 alone, the potential tariff revenue loss to developing countries due to the moratorium wasUSD 10 billion. The article further notes that removal of the moratorium could provide policy space for developing countries to regulate imports of electronic transmissions and generate annual tariff revenue of up to 40 times greater than that in developed countries.Acommunicationfrom Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, China, Iceland, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, and Uruguay, circulated in June 2020, highlights apaperby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) titled, ‘Electronic Transmissions and International Trade: Shedding New Light on the Moratorium Debate.’ The members state that, according to the paper, “the overall benefits” of duty-free electronic transmissions “outweigh the potential forgone government revenues” due to the moratorium. The members recommend that these findings be considered in the current discussions on the extension of the moratorium.A decision on whether or not the moratorium should continue will be taken at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12).

"The Inform project, executed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), has played a key role in promoting environmental data availability, management, and access in the region by supporting the development of the Pacific Environment Portal, 14 national environment data portals, and the Indicator Reporting Tool. The Indicator Reporting Tool was developed on the basis of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Indicator Reporting Information System.There are significant challenges associated with the lack of historical and current environmental data, and inadequate information management and access for decision making and reporting in Pacific island countries. The full name of the Inform project, ‘Building National and Regional Capacity to Implement Multilateral Environmental Agreements by Strengthening Planning and the State of Environmental Assessment and Reporting in the Pacific,’ recognizes the need for data-driven decision making. The Pacific Environment Portal and the Indicator Reporting Tool help address these challenges.The Pacific Environment Portal enables users to find, access, and reuse regional and national data. The Portal aims to provide easy access and safe storage for environmental datasets to be used for monitoring, evaluating, and analyzing environmental conditions and trends to support environmental planning, forecasting, and reporting requirements at all levels. National Environment Data Portals have also been developed for the 14 Pacific island SPREP members. The data from this network of portals are used to inform reporting on national, regional, and international frameworks using the Indicator Reporting Tool.TheIndicator Reporting Toolaims to simplify reporting processes and reduce the reporting burden by facilitating reuse of indicator definitions across multiple reporting obligations. The tool can be used for multilateral reporting obligations under Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) as well as national and state-based indicator reporting. It is targeted towards government officials responsible for compiling and producing indicator-based reports.In recent years, the 14 Pacific island countries have developed State of the Environment (SoE) reports,many of whichare alreadyapprovedandpublished. These SoE reports are developed using indicator assessments, and the Indicator Reporting Tool has facilitated “reusing environmental indicators” from one report to another. For instance, the Marshall Islands used its 2016 SoE as the main input for the country’s fifth national report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and Niue is using its SoE for its sixth national report to the CBD.

"An informal World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial gathering focused on trade policy challenges and priorities ahead of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12). Twenty-nine WTO members representing a wide range of trade policy interests discussed approaches to overcoming the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, proposals for facilitating trade and reducing trade barriers regarding medical goods, and environmental aspects of trade policy, among other issues.The virtual meeting convened on 29 January 2021 in place of the traditional informal WTO ministerial chaired by Switzerland in the margins of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos.According to the concluding remarks by the Chair, President of Switzerland Guy Parmelin, ministers emphasized the need to confirm the date and venue of MC12, which had beenpostponedto 2021 due to the pandemic. They also stressed the urgency of the prompt appointment of a new WTO Director-General. Having previously expressedreservationsabout Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, whose candidacy, according to the WTO, is “best poised to attain consensus,” the USindicatedthat “this important leadership decision” is “currently under active consideration in Washington.”With respect to the social and economic impacts of COVID-19, ministers highlighted the role of trade and the WTO in promoting recovery. Many underscored the importance to ensure equitable and affordable access to medical goods, includingvaccines, through implementation of trade facilitation measures, noting the role of intellectual property and transparency. Canadahighlightedthe Ottawa Group’s efforts on atrade and health initiativethat aims to “keep markets open, facilitate the distribution of vaccines, and better prepare for future global health crises.”Ministers resolved to “maintain a credible multilateral trading system” (MTS), supported by a “fully functional WTO dispute settlement system,” and committed to “restore a climate of mutual trust.”Ministers regretted that thefisheries subsidiesnegotiationscould not be completedby the 2020 deadline, and agreed that “a comprehensive and effective agreement” should be concluded “as soon as possible.”Many ministers called for progress on: agricultural trade policy reform; joint statement initiatives on services domestic regulation, e-commerce, investment facilitation, and trade and women’s economic empowerment; and the special and differential treatment of developing and least developed countries (LDCs). Several supported new initiatives to address global challenges, including theStructured Discussions on Trade and Environmental Sustainabilitylaunched during the WTO Trade and Environment Week 2020.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) expects that world trade will fall by 13% to 32% in 2020, due to the disruptions to economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Theexpectationswere discussed during a trade forecast press conference on 8 April 2020. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo highlighted that the crisis “is first and foremost a health crisis which has forced governments to take unprecedented measures to protect people’s lives.”The WTO offered two scenarios, noting that estimates of the expected recovery in 2021 are uncertain, and that recovery will depend on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy responses. Azevêdo emphasized the need to take action now to lay the foundations for a strong, sustained, and socially inclusive recovery.Under an optimistic scenario, the WTO projects that recovery will be strong enough to bring trade close to its pre-pandemic trend. A pessimistic scenario envisages a partial recovery only. Both scenarios expect that all regions will experience double-digit declines in exports and imports in 2020, except for the “Other regions” (Africa, Middle East and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) including associate and former member States). The reason for this disparity is that those countries are heavy exporters of energy products, and demand for these products is relatively unaffected by fluctuating prices.While many look to compare expectations for the current crisis with the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the WTO notes that the pandemic’s restrictions on movement and need for social distancing affect labor supply, transport, and travel in ways that were not present for the financial crisis. With the current situation, economic sectors ranging from hotels, restaurants, and tourism to non-essential retail trade, as well as some manufacturing, have been severely impacted. In addition, complex value chains have been affected by the pandemic, in particular for electronics and automotive products.In related news, the WTO and World Customs Organization (WCO) have pledged to collaborate to facilitate trade in essential goods such as medical supplies, food, and energy. In ajoint statementreleased on 6 April 2020, the Secretariats of the two organizations note that they have invited their members to increase transparency by sharing information on new trade and trade-related measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The joint statement also urges members to “ensure that any new border action is targeted, proportionate, transparent and non-discriminatory — as agreed by G20 leaders,” and to rescind the measures once they are no longer needed.SDG 17 includes a number of trade-relatedtargets, including promotion of a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the WTO (target 17.10) and significantly increasing the exports of developing countries (target 17.11).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"26 September 2019:Six donor countries recently announced funding commitments to help the world’s most vulnerable nations adapt to climate change through the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). The Global Environment Facility (GEF)-managed LDCF is the only multilateral fund fully dedicated to climate action in LDCs.The Governments of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden pledged a combined total of USD 160 million in new funding for the LDCF. Germany will contribute EUR 50 million; Sweden will provide approximately EUR 50 million over four years; the Netherlands will contribute an additional EUR 20 million; and Denmark plans to contribute an additional USD 31 million to the Fund in 2020, pending parliamentary approval.Furthermore, Canada announced an additional contribution of USD 7.5 million at last month’s G7 Summit in Biarritz, France. The UK has announced a doubling of its contribution to climate finance over five years, with its LDCF allocation yet to be determined.The announcements were discussed during a Ministerial Dialogue, hosted by the GEF, the Government of Germany and the LDC Group during Climate Week NYC, on 24 September 2019. The financing will be distributed as grants to support agriculture, improve disaster readiness and protect livelihoods as threats from storms, droughts and floods in LDCs increase.During the event, dialogue moderator Mary Robinson, Chair of the Elders and former President of Ireland, said the LDCF has been supporting access to improved water supplies, strengthening infrastructure, expanding access to improve flood and storm early warning systems, and facilitating the transition to climate-smart agriculture and sustainability. She said the LDCF represents a good model for financing climate adaptation priorities.The LDCF, which was established in 2001, has to date supported 282 projects in LDCs, with approximately USD 1.3 billion in grant resources. The projects are expected to directly reduce the vulnerability of more than 21 million people.

"The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has published recommendations on strengthening national-level progress on the SDGs with the use of corporate reporting. In particular, it outlines ways for governments to capture business action on the SDGs in their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).To better harness the participation of the private sector in SDG implementation, the report titled,‘Using Corporate Reporting to Strengthen Sustainable Development Goals,’ recommends that governments:Involve the private sector in every step of SDGs implementation;Facilitate and enforce effective SDGs disclosure by companies with best practice guidelines and regulations for mandatory reporting;Align with existing, widely used corporate disclosure practices and frameworks, such as the GRI Standards;Develop a measurement and monitoring tool to track private sector input, beginning with data made available through corporate sustainability reports, which is called for in SDG target 12.6; andEnable regular dialogue between business, policy, and investors to encourage collaboration and reinforce their respective SDGs contributions.The publication, which was released on 8 April 2020, aims to help countries prepare for the next round of VNRs during the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). According to the GRI authors, the VNR process provides “the perfect platform” for collaboration to increase impact. Capturing the contribution of the private sector is necessary for understanding what actions are needed and who can take them in order to achieve the SDG targets in each country.Peter Paul van de Wijs, GRI, said it is “already clear that progress is too slow” on achieving the Goals, making partnerships and collaboration crucial. He encouraged policy makers to “do more to understand and make the most of the contribution from the private sector.”The publication provides an overview of how VNRs to date have captured business contributions to the SDGs. In 2018, six countries included a specific section on the private sector: Ecuador, Greece, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, and Uruguay.In 2019, GRI reports that:Iceland recognized the key role of disclosing sustainability data and benchmarking companies, with a SDGs governmental working group engaged with the national center for corporate social responsibility to engage business on the SDGs;Mongolia recognized the need to encourage sustainability reporting by companies based on global principles and good national practices;Turkey conducted sectoral sustainability research covering reporting and SDG target 12.6, which concluded that more effort needs directed towards implementing corporate reporting practices; andThe Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued sustainability reporting guidelines for listed companies, which provides a framework for reporting on corporate contributions to the SDGs.The report also shares examples of how countries are advancing SDG target 12.6: “Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.” Most countries do not share data on their efforts to fulfill this target, GRI report. In 2019, only nine countries provided such an update.The authors stress that by increased business reporting on sustainability impacts would provide policy actors with valuable data to improve the assessment and implementation of the SDGs in their countries, and it would enable a government to engage with businesses on their contributions to the SDGs.The report was developed with financial support from the Government of Sweden.

"18 June 2019: The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has released its annual report on the state of education around the world. The 2019 report focuses for the first time on the theme of migration and displacement and finds that the numbers of migrant and refugee school-age children have grown by 26% since the year 2000.SDG target 4.5 calls for ensuring equal access to education for the vulnerable. This target is measured bySDG indicator 4.5.1, on parity related to education of people affected by conflict, among other groups for which data can be disaggregated.Lebanon has doubled its schools’ capacity in the wake of the Syrian crisis, opening its classrooms to 214,000 students.The report was launched during an event in Ramallah, Palestine. The 438-page report titled, ‘Migration, displacement and education – Building bridges, not walls’, highlights examples of effective work in providing education to children affected by conflict in different parts of the world, or who have come from such backgrounds. Case studies feature such efforts in Canada, Chad, Colombia, Ireland, Lebanon, the Philippines, Turkey and Uganda. For example, Lebanon, which hosts more refugees per capita than any other country in the world, has doubled its schools’ capacity in the wake of the Syrian crisis, opening its classrooms to 214,000 students – almost one-third of its pre-existing cohort of 750,000 students.The report calls on governments to address the education needs of migrant and displaced populations with the same attention they would give to their own people – protecting their right to education, planning for their education needs, and including them in national education systems. It also calls for representing migration and education histories accurately to challenge prejudices and build inclusive societies, and invest in teacher education to build their ability to work with diverse, multilingual and multicultural student populations.In a foreword to the report, Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand and Chair of the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Advisory Board, emphasizes that education must be “a key part of the response to migration and displacement,” and that education has the power to overcome stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination.The report calls on countries and development partners to give greater support to the Technical Cooperation Group (TCG) on SDG 4, which is convened by UNESCO and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The TCG acts as a platform for countries to cooperate on measuring progress toward SDG 4 (quality education).

It is built by “a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about buildings, roads, trails, waterways, cafés, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.” The resource emphasizes local knowledge, is community driven, and is “open data,” meaning that anyone can use it for any purpose as long as OSM is credited.OSM data that can be accessed through the Pacific Environment Portal, comes as a bundle of individual Geographic Information System (GIS) layers, pre-styled in a Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) project, which people can use as a base map or combine with other spatial datasets.Datasets like buildings, roads, rivers, and points of interest are available for all 14 Pacific Island countries involved in theInform Project: the Cook Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM); Fiji; Kiribati; the Marshall Islands; Nauru; Niue; Palau; Papua New Guinea (PNG); Samoa; Solomon Islands; Tonga; Tuvalu; and Vanuatu. In addition, OSM data for seven Pacific territories will also be added: Guam; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; American Samoa; French Polynesia; New Caledonia; Tokelau; and Wallis and Futuna.The goal is to increase awareness among Pacific GIS users of the richness of OSM data in Pacific countries, as well as potential gaps, so that they can take advantage of the tool and contribute to it by joining the OSM global community.A representative from Kiribati highlighted the usefulness of the data. He noted that “the available OpenStreetMap data was well received by the newly established GIS Unit from the Environment and Conservation Division (Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development) in Kiribati,” which “explored the use of the OSM map of Tarawa as a base map for our ongoing waste management map project, particularly for the densely populated urban areas.” “Over the course of time,” he said, “the staff plan to make some adjustments, map additions, and corrections to the OSM project, at least for Tarawa,” and highlighted the potential of the OSM project to carry “other benefits for our project reports and presentations in the future.” [IISD Knowledge Hub Sources] [Pacific Environment Portal]* * *This story was made possible with funding support from the Government of Sweden through the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and was developed with the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) using thePacific Environment Portal, which enables users to find, access, and use regional and national data.

The following year, the Government of Canada released an interim report titled, ‘Towards Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy.’ This report identifies five national priorities: leadership, governance, and policy coherence; awareness, engagement, and partnership; accountability, transparency, and reporting; reconciliation and the 2030 Agenda; and investing in the SDGs.The SDG Toolkit portion of the resource identifies practical approaches to align an organization’s work with the SDGs. It offers ideas for how a group can select the first steps to take, identify existing alignment with the SDGs, plan for future alignment, and learn from examples of other community foundations.Among the interconnected challenges for organizations seeking to align with the SDGs, the resource identifies: time constraints, given that the SDGs have a tight deadline for action; and the need to learn a new “language,” build capacity and new partnerships, and break out of silos.The CFC is also supporting community foundations working on the SDGs through its Vital Signs program, which is prioritizing the collection of data that aligns to the 2030 Agenda to make relevant and standardized indicators available to community foundations. The toolkit notes that, in 2021, community foundations will have the opportunity to use a digital platform to host and share community data aligned to the SDGs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"18 June 2019: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) announced a partnership to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy and help achieve sustainable development.IRENA and UNDP will explore joint initiatives to help implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, its SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change by increasing renewable energy investments in developing countries, among other activities. The partnership will bring together IRENA’s technical expertise and renewable energy data repository, and UNDP’s climate change portfolio and development and project implementation network.According to a recentIRENA report, renewables have become one of the cheapest sources of new power generation, due to falling renewable energy costs, and the number of jobs in the sector continues to grow.The partnership’s Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on 17 June 2019, by UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner and IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera, who said the partnership will enable the exploration and development of pathways to advance energy access, accelerate the low-carbon energy transition and promote sustainable growth.Africa and Southeast Asia are priority regions for meeting the increasing energy demand with renewables instead of coal.During a meeting with UN Secretary-General António Guterres on 18 June, La Camera indicated his intention to increase IRENA’s cooperation with UN organizations. Guterres suggested that IRENA could help strengthenUN Energy, the UN’s mechanism for inter-agency collaboration on energy, which was established in 2004 as a subsidiary of the UN System Chief Executives Board (CEB).Guterres and La Camera underlined the need to phase out construction of new coal plants, and La Camera noted IRENA’s efforts to help countries develop policies that minimize disruption while accelerating their transition from coal to renewables. In this area of work, Africa and Southeast Asia are priority regions for meeting increasing energy demand with renewables instead of coal.

"5 August 2019: The Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI) formally launched its online platform for SDG knowledge in the Caribbean. The event took place in Trinidad and Tobago, which will present a voluntary national review (VNR) of SDG implementation during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).Released in May 2019, the Caribbean Civil Society SDGs Knowledge Platform contains information on SDG implementation related to both national and regional levels, and with a focus on the role of civil society organizations (CSOs). It aims to promote and enhance civil society inclusion in SDG implementation, monitoring and reporting.The platform enables CSOs to:showcase stories relating to their role in and experience of implementing the SDGs;network to discuss experiences, exchange ideas and share lessons learned; andcollaborate to enhance the capacity, voice and visibility of CSOs in national and regional SDG policies and actions.The Platform was launched on 30 July 2019, during an event convened by CANARI in partnership with the EU. Speakers highlighted the critical roles of CSOs in national development, and said the platform serves to facilitate such inputs. With regard to the preparation of Trinidad and Tobago’s VNR in 2020, speakers said the Platform can “enhance partnership and dialogue between civil society and government.”EU Ambassador Aad Biesebroek said CSOs help translate government policies into concrete measures that benefit all people. He emphasized the need for: continuing reflection and assessment regarding SDG implementation, financing and promotion; and aligning political priorities and national development policies in Trinidad and Tobago to achieve the SDGs.The knowledge platform supports the goals of CANARI’sCSOs for Good Governance(CSOs4GoodGov) project, which is supported by the EU. The project aims to enhance civil society’s contribution to governance and development processes in the Trinidad and Tobago, and in implementing the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda.CANARI, part of a Trinidad and Tobago consortium of seven CSOs, seeks to promote equitable participation and effective collaboration in managing natural resources for development. CANARI’s programmes focus on capacity building, policy planning and development, research, sharing and disseminating lessons learned, and fostering regional partnerships.Trinidad and Tobago is one of two Caribbean countries planning to present its firstVNR in 2020, along with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. To date, 45 other countries have indicated their intent to report at the 2020 HLPF.

"With reports of new record high temperatures, summer in the Northern hemisphere has yet again reminded us of the urgency of climate response. People are returning from vacations to a packed September agenda, with SDG 13 (climate action) occupying a prominent place in the beginning of the 73rd UNGA session.Anadditional negotiating sessionto facilitate the timely completion of the Paris Agreement work programme (PAWP) at the24th sessionof the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC will convene in Bangkok, Thailand, at the beginning of the month. The conference is expected to advance discussions on mitigation and adaptation aspects of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), transparency of action and support, the global stocktake (GST), the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, and other issues. A set of seven “tools” issued by the Co-Chairs of theAd HocWorking Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) ahead of the session will aid negotiations.TheGlobal Climate Action Summit, convened by Governor Jerry Brown and the State of California in San Francisco, US, will continue to build momentum towards COP 24 in December. The high-level event will be facilitated by Governor Brown, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action Michael Bloomberg, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, Mahindra Group Chair Anand Mahindra, Xie Zhenhua, Special Representative for Climate Change Affairs, China, and Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth. By providing a platform for state and local governments, business representatives and civil society to showcase climate actions at all levels, the Summit is expected to inspire deeper commitments and accelerated action to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.Coming on the heels of the Summit isClimate Week NYC 2018, which will bring together multiple stakeholders for a series of panel discussions, concerts, exhibitions and seminars that will seek to catalyze further climate action by addressing issues related to climate policy, investments and finance, future energy, the SDGs, science, clean transport, sustainable food and travel, and retail.

"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has updated its Global Portal to Information on Chemical Substances (eChemPortal). The Portal increases access to information for all stakeholders, providing data to support health and environment decisions concerning chemicals.The eChemPortal:provides free access to information on existing chemicals, new industrial chemicals, pesticides and biocides;enables quick and efficient use and exchange of such information;details chemicals’ exposure and use information; andincludes links to information prepared for government chemical programmes at the national, regional and international levels.It also provides classification results according to hazard classification schemes, such as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The latest version – eChemPortal v3.0 – has an updated user interface and design. It enables users to search for chemical information through a quick search function, filter and sort on results tables, and get a preliminary indication of the number of results expected in a search by chemical properties.By the end of 2020, it is expected that: all information needed to assess risks of chemicals to human health and the environment will be linked or directly included in eChemPortal; all relevant data sources freely available through the internet will be linked through the eChemPortal; and a commitment to reliable chemical identification will continue to facilitate efficient searches through user-friendly entry points. OECD plans to achieve this by: bringing information sources and data formats into a uniform presentation format; raising the awareness of relevant audiences about the Portal; and eliminating duplication of work across national and regional assessment programmes.eChemPortal was launched by the OECD in 2007, initially focusing on hazard information for existing chemicals. It enabled users to search for substances by name or identification number. In 2010, the Portal was redesigned to enable searches also by chemical property. In 2015, another search tool was included to enable users searching for an individual chemical to view GHS classifications that have been reviewed by a regulatory body or intergovernmental organization, and direct links to information in participating data sources were added.eChemPortal was implemented using the common electronic data formats prescribed by the OECD Harmonised Templates for Reporting Chemical Test Summaries, which were designed to create a consistent way of reporting information across regulatory programmes. eChemPortal contributes to the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), particularly its recommendation to “facilitate public access to appropriate information and knowledge of chemicals throughout their life cycle.” [eChemPortal Vision Statement] [eChemPortal Website] [eChemPortal brochure]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Government of the Republic of Korea Forest Service (KFS) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish the Peace Forest Initiative (PFI). The Initiative will support land and forest rehabilitation in post conflict areas to reduce peace and security challenges stemming from natural resource degradation.Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, and Chong-Ho Park, Minister of KFS, Republic of Korea, signed the MoU on 28 January 2020.  The goal of the PFI is to “offer countries recovering from violent conflict an opportunity to achieve stability and trust while re-building livelihoods and economies.” Speaking on the Initiative, Thiaw said it “will help address some of the most challenging situations of transboundary management of shared natural resources while promoting peace and cooperation.” Chong-Ho Park said that “the PFI is an effective tool to promote cooperation on the restoration of degraded land and forest in conflict-affected areas.”The PFI will support land degradation neutrality through partnerships that build peace and security.The PFI was initially launched on 10 September 2019 during the 14th Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD in New Delhi, India. In supporting needs assessments, the Initiative will engender collaboration, provide guidance, support transparency and support local parties to conflict to resolve their disputes and grievances. The PFI also aims to contribute to land degradation neutrality (LDN) implementation through partnerships that build peace and security.The PFI launch precedes the commencement of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030.

"World Wildlife Day (WWD), held annually on 3 March, is meant to celebrate biodiversity and raise global awareness of our relationship with plants and animals. The event has never been timelier. The rapidly spreading coronavirus issuspectedto have jumped from the most trafficked species on Earth (pangolins), while the world’s leading scientists have concluded that an anthropogenic-drivencrisisnow threatens at least one million species with extinction.With the WWD convening under the theme, ‘Sustaining all Life on Earth’, has there ever been a more pressing time to draw attention to the links between humanity and the Earth’s flora and fauna? Nature is waving warning flags.There were some notable announcements on the Day. Technology companies of the ‘Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online’ said they removed or blocked over three million listings for endangered and threatened species and associated products from their online platforms, to date. The results were publicized as part of the report titled, ‘Offline and in the Wild,’ produced by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)-led coalition.In partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Ocean Agency launchedGlowing Glowing Gone, a creative awareness campaign to bring attention to coral fluorescence due to climate change. The campaign’spress releaseinstructs that corals fluoresce as a last line of defense before dying or bleaching, a phenomena made more common by warming seas. The Ocean Agency worked with Pantone and Adobe to turn the warning colors of glowing coral into three official Pantone colors, to inspire action that everyone can use.The Day also saw traditional and high-level awareness raising. The Ambassador of India to the UN in New York, the Head of the Delegation of the European Union to the UN, the CITES Secretary-General, and the President of the Wildlife Conservation Society were among speakers at a high-level event at UN Headquarters in New York. On the creative front, Jackson Wild™ led the organization of the fifth iteration of a wildlife-themed film festival with some 350 entries, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare held an international WWDyouth art contestthat featured youth artists’ expressions of the Day’s theme.Just after the Day,UNEP announcedthat the theme of the fifth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) will be: ‘Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The session is set to take place from 22-26 February 2021 in Nairobi, Kenya. Speaking on the UNEA theme, Sveinung Rotevatn, Norway’s Minister of Climate and the Environment and President of the Assembly said, “Nature is the solution we in many ways take for granted, but that we cannot afford to lose.” Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, while addressing the WWD, pointed out that humanity seems to have “forgotten just how much we need nature for our survival and well-being.”As the UN dubbed ‘Super Year’ crescendos towards global agenda-setting meetings onoceansand a post-2020biodiversityframework, events on World Wildlife Day highlighted that humanity needs to notice that glowing corals aren’t the only thing signaling, ‘Going … Going … Gone.’ [UNEP Press Release] [UNDP Press Release] [UN News] [WWF Press Release] [WWD Landing Page] [Policy Brief on Nature]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Food export restrictions and farm subsidies were among the measures discussed at a special meeting of the World Trade Organization’s regular Committee on Agriculture on 18 June, held to review the measures that governments have introduced since the COVID-19 outbreak.Although almost two dozen countries are believed to have restricted food exports since the COVID-19 outbreak, only four of these measures have been officially notified to the global trade body. With food importing countries concerned about the impact of these measures on their own consumers, officials from Japan and Switzerland were among thosequestioningexporters such as the Russian Federation and Ukraine about the measures that had been introduced.Kyrgyz Republic, North Macedonia, Thailand, and Ukraine have reported restrictions on wheat, flour, rice, sugar, eggs, and buckwheat to the trade body in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Trading partners asked why the measures had not been notified in advance, and questioned whether the countries faced a critical shortage of the product concerned.Other measures discussed include restrictions imposed by Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Romania, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Vietnam.Datacollectedby the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) indicates that many measures imposed or announced were temporary restrictions, and have since expired or been lifted.Farm subsidy schemes were also in the spotlight, with exporting countries in particular concerned that the measures unveiled since the start of the pandemic could prevent their own producers from competing fairly on markets for food and farm goods.The US Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, a package of US$ 16 billion announced in May, prompted questions from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, and New Zealand. Trade officials wanted more details on how support under the scheme would be calculated, as well as how it would be classed under WTO domestic support rules.The US in turn was among governments seeking additional information on support measures in the EU, alongside other trading partners. The European Commissionsubmittedanadhoc report on the measures taken by the bloc and by EU member states, which provided details of the EUR 80 million it was providing as private storage aid for dairy products, sheep meat and beef.Initiatives to support the farm sector in Japan, China, India, and Turkey were also discussed by trade officials at the meeting.At the meeting, negotiating groups also presented a number of declarations on trade and food security, including astatementby a group of countries convened by Canada, and a separatestatementfrom the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries. Both statements called for markets for food and agriculture to remain open and predictable.In a separate development, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)releasedits annual agricultural policy monitoring and evaluation report, including analysis of how governments have responded to the COVID-19 outbreak. The OECD looked at over 400 policy responses in more than 50 countries, and found that governments had taken measures both to restrict and facilitate trade in the wake of the pandemic.Further details of the special meeting of the WTO committee on agriculture can be found onlinehere.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The 2020 session of the UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD) recognized the significant challenges the region faces in achieving the SDGs. Participants called for accelerating the region’s progress to support the Decade of Action and Delivery.Over 300 stakeholders participated in the virtual meeting, which convened on 19 March. UNECE originally planned to hold a one- and a half day Forum with 15 sessions and a focus on peer learning. In response to the COVID-10 pandemic, UNECE changed the conference to an entirely virtual meeting. Special webinars focused on solutions to challenges in delivering on the SDGs and the importance of gender-responsive standards, policy coherence and reliable statistics. A virtual Civil Society Meeting, which coordinated the inputs of over 150 civil society partners across the region, preceded the Forum.In opening remarks, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed said “we have not yet seen the broad and deep transformative change that the 2030 Agenda requires.” She stressed, “there is no denying that we have a mountain to climb over the coming decade” and emphasized a sense of urgency for all regional fora for the SDGs.UNECE presented the findings of a first regional report on SDG progress, which finds “some good progress and many gaps” on the way to transformative change in the UNECE region. Thereporttitled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators and finds increased ambition is needed to meet environmental targets. The Forum also discussed how Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) contribute to realizing the SDGs in the region.Countries shared concrete actions to accelerate SDG progress and advance green and inclusive change, such as the UNECE Trees in the Cities Challenge. European Commission (EC) representative, Luca Marmo, presented the European Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan. Finland shared its strategy to become carbon neutral by 2035, and Denmark highlighted its Youth Climate Advisory Council as a channel for youth engagement in Denmark.Alongside calls for accelerating SDG efforts, participants recognized the need for solidarity and multilateralism, given the COVID-19 pandemic.

"1 July 2019: The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has released a report that finds a 5% increase in renewable energy in 2017, compared to 2016. The report presents data for 130 countries, and highlights trends on renewable energy worldwide.The report titled, ‘Renewable Energy Statistics 2019,’ provides data on power-generation capacity for 2009-2018 and actual power generation for 2009-2017 as well as data on renewable energy for over 130 countries and areas. In 2017, total electricity generated from renewables was 6,191 terawatt-hours (TWh). Hydropower remained the dominant form of renewable energy, making up 65% of renewables, followed by wind energy (18%), bioenergy (8%), solar energy (7%) and geothermal energy (2%).In 2017, renewable energy generation growth was 293 TWh higher than in 2016. Solar and wind energy contributed to the sector’s overall growth: solar energy increased 35% compared to 2016, and wind power generation increased 19% compared to 2016. These two sectors account for 70% of growth since 2013. In contrast, overall hydropower generation declined in 2017, mostly in Europe and also in Eurasia and South America. Asia and North America recorded slight expansion of hydro generation.In 2017, Asia’s share of global wind generation equaled Europe’s in 2017.The Asia region demonstrated the most growth in renewable electricity generation, similar to recent years. In 2017, Asia’s share of global renewable generation reached 39%, and its share of global wind generation equaled Europe’s in 2017. Other regions’ share of renewable generation are as follows: Europe and North America at 20%; South America at 13%; and Eurasia at 5%.Overall, renewables accounted for 24% of electricity consumption in 2016, an increase by 1% since 2015. Renewable energy generation was 23.7% in 2016 and 24.4% in 2017. SDG target 7.2 aims to “substantially” increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.Public investment in renewable energy has increased to a record high of USD 29 billion in 2017, an increase of USD 3 billion, or nearly 12%, compared to 2016. In addition, international support for investment in renewable energy reached USD 18.6 billion in 2016. SDG indicator 7.a.1 measures international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy.IRENA’s latest statistics feature some minor revisions to the 2018 renewable generating capacity reported in March 2019. For 2018, total renewable generating capacity has been revised upwards by 5 gigawatt (GW) to 2,356 GW, and off-gird electricity capacity has been revised downwards by 0.5 GW to 8.4 GW. The downward revision is primarily the result of a reduction in off-grid bioenergy capacity reported by Malaysia.

"28 June 2019: A mapping of SDG coverage by the UN General Assembly (UNGA), UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and other UN bodies and fora in light of the 2030 Agenda has been shared with governments. The co-facilitators of this intergovernmental process also set out possible criteria for reducing overlaps and duplication between intergovernmental UN bodies and forums.Discussions on alignment and coherence between UN organs started in 2016 during the 70th session of the UNGA, and continued during the subsequent UNGA sessions, with the Permanent Representatives of Czech Republic and Timor-Leste facilitating consultations during the 73rd session. On 28 June, the co-facilitators shared a draftnoteoutlining conclusions from preceding informal consultations and expert-level informal-informal consultations held to date.Per the note, delegations have outlined the importance of the “full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda” with a focus on poverty eradication in all its forms and dimensions. They also decided to update themappingof SDGs and targets, which had originally been prepared under the leadership of Colombia during UNGA 70. The initial mapping had shown, among other observations, that the majority of SDGs contain targets either covered in existing UNGA and/or ECOSOC agendas, or that could be covered by making use of existing agenda items. It also found that the targets of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) are “largely uncovered under the UNGA and ECOSOC agendas.”The co-facilitators included the updated and “simplified” version of themappingas an annex to their note, explaining that the newer version looks at how the SDGs, rather than their targets, are addressed by the agendas of various UN bodies. Taking the form of a table, the document includes, for each SDG, relevant information related to the work of the UNGA’s Second Committee (Economic and Financial), Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural), other committees, ECOSOC, and ECOSOC subsidiary bodies. According to the co-facilitators, the mapping does not include the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since it has the mandate to cover all SDGs and to oversee a network of follow-up and review processes at the global level. Neither does it include ECOSOC’s High-level Segment or Integration Segment, which have an annual theme identical to the HLPF’s, and may address issues related to any SDG.The co-facilitators also shared, as a second annex to their note, a document comprising possible criteria for reducing overlaps and duplication. For example, the document states that an overlap or duplication might be justified if an item relates to an issue mandated to be mainstreamed in the work of all UN bodies (such as gender mainstreaming) or the item is a cross-cutting issue (such as financing).Consultations were expected to resume on 3 July.

While still focusing on animal species, WWF will seek to build coalitions of partners at the river basin level and adopt an integrated and holistic approach to protecting freshwater resources.Some of the highlights described in its freshwater brief are efforts to promote resilience in Asian deltas, maintenance of Asian flyways for migratory birds, and conservation of river dolphins in some of the world’s largest rivers.In a four-pageFreshwater Initiatives Brief,WWF outlines key areas of activity, namely: resilient Asian deltas; free-flowing rivers; Asian flyways; water sources in Africa, and river dolphins in the Amazon, Ganges, Indus, Mekong, Irrawaddy and Yangtze Rivers. A bar chart shows stages of implementation in each focus area, from the early concept stage to proposal development through to funding and implementation.The brief shows a concentration of “bankable projects” in Africa, Asia and Europe. Efforts in Central and South America are also underway, with efforts to protect the transboundary Pantanal wetlands in Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay, and safeguard almost 300 “water reserves” created in Mexico.WWF also cites some of the major gains achieved through prior work, including an increase in river dolphin populations in the Indus and Mekong Rivers, European Union endorsement of an urgent action plan on sturgeon, and Zambia’s cancellation of a proposed hydro-power dam on the Luangwa River.

"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has released a publication with recommendations on how to manage the world’s peatlands. Titled ‘Peatland Mapping and Monitoring,’ the publication amalgamates the work of 35 expert authors from 14 countries, and highlights experiences from tropical peatland countries such as Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, as well as temperate regions.According to the UN, approximately 15% of the world’s peatlands have already been drained mainly for cropping, grazing, forestry and extraction, with hotspots of peatland degradation found in Europe, Russia and Northern America, southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Amazon basin. In Indonesia, peatlands drainage coupled with deforestation have contributed to extensive fires that impact regional air quality and health.“Mapping peatlands to know their location, extent and greenhouse gas emissions potential, can help countries to plan and better manage their land, water and biodiversity, mitigating climate change and adapting to it more effectively,” said Maria Nuutinen, FAO’s lead peatlands expert and guidelines co-author.The publication is accessible in SEPAL, as part of FAO’s geospatial toolkit. According to FAO, “the peatland monitoring module provides up-to-date data on soil moisture trends to help detect drainage and monitor restoration efforts. Soil moisture maps can be updated every two weeks using Sentinel-1 imagery from the European Space Agency.”FAO’s online mapping technology has already been successfully implemented in Indonesia, which has 40% of all tropical peatlands. [UN Press Release] [FAO Press Release] [Publication:Peatland Mapping and Monitoring] [SEPAL]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
"The NDC Partnership has released a report on advances in countries’ climate ambition during 2020, which was the first milestone in the five-year cycle of the Paris Agreement on climate change. By 2020 countries were expected to submit an enhanced version of their 2015 Nationally Determined Contribution to the aims of the Paris Agreement.The NDC Partnership supports countries to mobilize governments and societies behind their shared plan for climate action. In the report, the head of the secretariat for the Partnership – Pablo Vieira, Global Director, NDC Partnership Support Unit – writes that many countries presented revised NDCs that reflect greater ambition. However, overall efforts “remain far below those demanded by the Paris Agreement,” and countries will face rising temperatures “for the foreseeable future.”Ministers from Costa Rica and the Netherlands served as co-chairs of the Partnership for 2019-2020. In their foreword to the report, the co-chairs add to Vieira’s cautionary note, reporting that climate finance is still short of the USD 100 billion needed each year, and far below the levels needed. At the same time, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it even more difficult to generate political attention and financial capital.However, the co-chairs report that they see countries willing to lead, international partners are responding with commitment and flexibility, and visions are emerging for rebuilding economies in ways that combine inclusive development with a safer climate.According to the report, three themes feature in many countries’ requests for NDC support: mainstreaming climate action into sustainable development; financing climate action; and enhancing NDC quality and raising ambition. On mainstreaming, the report notes that embedding NDCs into countries’ decision-making processes is a powerful tool for change, and has taken on new dimensions amid the pandemic. Of the 74 countries where the Partnership is active, 53 have requested support to work on inclusive growth, in particular by improving social inclusion and reducing inequalities. The authors argue that these requests reflect “growing recognition of the links between climate change and social inclusion.” The approach also means that a broader range of sectoral ministries and stakeholders are being involved in climate action.On climate finance, the report finds this to be the most frequently requested area of support among NDC Partnership countries. Governments have welcomed “embedded economic advisors” who can provide targeted support for ministries of finance or planning. The top areas of need for financing climate action include: assessing the climate impacts of a country’s macroeconomic situation; costing the NDCs; stimulating green growth, and applying global recommendations to the national context.On enhancing NDCs, the report provides examples of country approaches driving climate action and enhanced ambition over the past three years. [Publication:Partnership in Action 2020: Keeping Ambition Alive] [UNFCCC NDC registry]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has released a report that finds ocean areas are increasingly experiencing low levels of oxygen, which threatens marine ecosystems and fish species that are already impacted by ocean warming and acidification. IUCN released the report at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP25) to the UNFCCC.The report titled, ‘Ocean deoxygenation: Everyone’s problem,’ represents the largest peer-reviewed study conducted on oxygen deoxygenation. The report examines the causes, impacts and potential solutions to ocean deoxygenation. Climate change and nutrient pollution are the main drivers of ocean oxygen loss, and ocean oxygen loss is “closely related to ocean warming and acidification” caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and biogeochemical consequences related to anthropogenic fertilization of the ocean.The report finds that ocean regions with low oxygen concentrations have expanded at all depths of the ocean. In the 1960’s, 45 sites were affected by low oxygen conditions. In 2010, the report finds, approximately 700 sites around the world are affected by low oxygen conditions, translating into a 2% decrease in global ocean oxygen between 1960 to 2010.  In addition, the volume of areas depleted of oxygen, known as “anoxic waters”, have quadrupled. The report cautions that very low ocean oxygen can affect the cycling of critical elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorous.The report states that deoxygenation is beginning to impact the balance of marine life, favoring species tolerant of low-oxygen conditions, like jellyfish, some squid and microbes, at the expense of species sensitive to low-oxygen, including most fish and many marine species. Tuna, sharks and marlins are especially sensitive to low oxygen because of their energy demands and large size; as oxygen in the ocean decreases, these species are driven into increasingly shallow surface layers of oxygen rich water, which makes them vulnerable to overfishing.“As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray.”Under a business-as-usual scenario, the ocean is predicted to lose 3-4% of its global oxygen by 2100. The report warns, however, that this global average “masks local changes that are predicted to be […] more severe in mid to high latitudes.” Most losses are expected to be concentrated in the upper 1000m of the water column, the area richest in marine biodiversity. The report concludes there is an urgent need to “dramatically raise our ambitions to tackle and immediately curb our emissions” before human actions “irreparably impact and change the conditions favorable for life on earth.”IUCN Acting Director, Grethel Aguliar, said the report shows the significant impact of climate change on the ocean. “As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray,” she said and urged world leaders to “commit to immediate and substantial emission cuts” to curb ocean oxygen loss and address other climate impacts. Sweden’s Minister for Environment, Isabella Lövin,called for putting “ocean deoxygenation among our top priorities in order to restore ocean health.” [IUCN Press Release] [Publication:Ocean deoxygenation: Everyone’s problem] [IUCN Publication Webpage]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
"The UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Government of Singapore and partners launched a global technology and innovation initiative for sustainable agriculture titled ‘Cultiv@te.’ The initiative, which aims to transform agricultural practices in light of increasing strains from climate change and pressures on food supplies, was announced on 12 November at the Singapore FinTech Festival.Cultiv@te will curate multi-stakeholder coalitions to tackle major challenges faced by developing countries and explore opportunities in urban agriculture, climate resilience and livestock farming.Through the programme, mature growth-stage startups and research and development teams from academic institutions, together with local innovators, technology experts, corporate mentors, and financiers, will co-design solutions with farmers and policy makers in a number of emerging markets that have large potential and needs. Applications are open viawww.cultivate.technology.Hazri Hassan, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore, explained that the government decided to launch this initiative together with UNDP as Singapore currently imports more than 90% of its food, which makes it vulnerable to disruptions in the global food supply. To address this, the government has set a target to locally produce 30% of Singapore’s foodstuff needs by 2030. To do so, it will transform its agri-food sector to raise productivity, invest in innovation and adopt sustainable technologies.Edwin Chow, Enterprise Singapore, added that open innovation is becoming “increasingly important” in driving the development of tech solutions that are both novel and practical in addressing real-world problems. He said Cultiv@te will help companies and governments to access a wider pool of solution providers, while allowing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startups to validate the market need for their new and existing technology.Bradley Busetto, UNDP, highlighted the importance of having globally-sourced technologies and innovations combine in new ways with market insights, know-how and traditional farming practices to positively impact sustainability and livelihoods of farming communities.

"The resumed ninth session of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group to Enhance the Functioning of the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing (MLS) of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA or Treaty) convened with the expectation to conclude negotiations on a package of measures to enhance the functioning of the MLS.In June 2019, the Working Group made significant advances, including tentative agreement to amend Annex I of the Treaty (list of crops in the MLS), and progress on revising the Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA). Rates for benefit-sharing payments, and information related to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA), also referred to as genetic sequence data or digital sequence information (DSI), remained as the main outstanding issues. The meeting was thus suspended to allow for additional time to finalize negotiations.However, at the three-day resumed session from 24-26 October 2019, at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) in Rome, Italy, the Working Group was unable to bridge positions between the developed and the developing world. TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinanalysis of the meeting indicates that “delegates’ inability to reach consensus on the basis of a Co-Chairs’ compromise proposal dealing with the most controversial elements as a package resulted in re-opening the draft revised Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) and the draft resolution—the main texts under consideration—and inserting a significant number of proposed revisions.” While there were hopes going into the meeting that it would conclude with an agreement, the Working Group now “needs to manage ‘a crisis in their hands,'” according to Co-Chair Hans Hoogeveen (Netherlands).TheEarth Negotiations Bulletincoverage of the meeting indicates that deep principled divergences remained, in particular regarding benefit-sharing payments from use of genetic sequence data. Co-Chairs Hoogeveen and Javad Mozafari (Iran) issued a compromise proposal on a package of elements, addressing benefit-sharing payment rates, benefit-sharing from genetic sequence data, and the review of the enhanced MLS, but consensus was not reached on the draft.The Co-Chairs will hold informal consultations immediately prior to the Governing Body (GB) session to be held from 11-16 November 2019, with one or two representatives from each region, in a final attempt to reach consensus.

"The first brief of the Brookings Institution’s ‘City Playbook for Advancing the SDGs’ explores the local governance structure used in Bristol, United Kingdom.Authored by Allan Macleod, Bristol City Council, thebrieftitled, ‘Why the One City model works: Local governance to achieve the SDGs and leave no one behind,’ reviews the city’s response to shrinking budgets over the past decade.Beginning in 2016, the City Office began convening biannual stakeholder gatherings (called “City Gatherings”) as well as citizen consultations to identify shared priorities and challenges. The brief reports that City Gatherings are now attended by over 250 stakeholders.A “One City Plan” was developed out of these consultations. The Plan identifies a shared vision and objectives, and opportunities for partners to be involved in improving the city. Six “One City boards” meet quarterly to discuss issues related to six themes: Connectivity, Economy, Environment, Health and Wellbeing, Homes and Communities, and Learning and Skills.The brief provides an overview of the governance structure of the Plan, noting that it is supported by a small core team that facilitates partnerships and empowers stakeholder action. The author also notes strengths and weaknesses of the model, highlighting challenges with asking partners to support work that “should be covered by local taxation.”The Brookings Institution’s ‘City Playbook for Advancing the SDGs’ series provides how-to briefs and case studies on advancing sustainable development and social progress locally. The briefs focus on four themes: Governance and Partnerships; Data and Measuring Progress; SDG Priorities; and Budgeting and Finance. The briefs come from cities participating in Brookings’ SDG Leadership Cities community of practice.

"23 September 2019: The Green Climate Fund (GCF), UN Development Programme (UNDP), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) launched the ‘Climate Investment Platform’ (CIP) to scale up climate action and catalyze the flow of capital to clean energy initiatives. The CIP will present its progress at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC in December 2019.By 2025, the Platform aims to directly mobilize USD 1 trillion in clean energy investment in 20 least developed countries (LDCs). The Platform addresses four building blocks, or “tracks,” along the climate finance value chain: supporting governments to scale up their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), including specification of ambitious energy targets; establishing clean energy policies and regulations; financial de-risking of energy prices; and supporting access to capital markets to connect clean energy investors with projects. Together, these four tracks aim to promote a comprehensive framework to deliver system-wide transformation that addresses both mitigation and adaptation. The CIP’s first service line focuses on the global transition to clean energy, recognizing that energy accounts for two-thirds of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The CIP will accelerate system-wide change and deliver co-benefits across the SDGs.IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera said renewable energy and energy efficiency “can deliver 90% of the emissions reductions needed under the Paris Agreement on climate change, but investment and deployment must increase significantly.” La Camera said the CIP combines the strengths of the respective organizations to “deliver tailored, proactive policy and investment support to set the energy transformation on a climate-safe path.” GCF Executive Director, Yannick Glemarec, said the CIF “will simplify access to climate finance.”Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), Rachel Kyte, said the CIP will help “bridge the gap between supply and demand to accelerate capital and scale up climate-resilient investments,” which will enable countries to increase their climate ambition. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said the CIP will “accelerate system-wide change and deliver co-benefits across the SDGs – from employment and economic growth to reduced inequalities and improved health.”The CIP plans to launch additional services on adaptation, land use, and cities and infrastructure in the first quarter of 2020.The Platform was launched ahead of theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.

"20 July 2019: The International Labour Organization (ILO) has released a report emphasizing the need for “urgent acceleration of efforts” to achieve SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). The report charts progress to date and articulates interlinkages between sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth, proposing an integrated policy framework moving forward.Titled, ‘Time to Act for SDG 8: Integrating Decent Work, Sustained Growth and Environmental Integrity,’ the report aims to improve understanding of the Goal at three levels: empirical, conceptual and policy. It does so by outlining progress towards the 12 targets of the Goal, mapping the interlinkages between SDG 8’s targets and those of other Goals, and describing a positive spiral of policy options and institutional support that can create the enabling environment for achieving the three dimensions of the Goal.The authors question wealthy countries’ continued growth-based approach, and highlight the need for new policy choices.On progress to date, the report describes a context of slowing and uneven economic growth. It notes that least developed countries (LDCs) are falling short of their target growth rate of 7%, and flags that progress on reducing participation in the informal economy has been slow, with informal workers representing 61% of the global workforce.On trends in gender and youth, the report highlights that gender pay gaps remain pervasive. The rate of young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) is higher for women and youth in low- and middle-income countries.On interlinkages, the report emphasizes that in order to achieve SDG 8, progress must also be made on Goals 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 1 (no poverty), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). It notes that decent work can be both an outcome and a driver of these other SDGs, and stresses that progress towards Goal 10 (reduced inequalities) is also key to “ensuring that productivity gains translate into higher incomes and wages for all.” Linking to the environmental dimension of the SDGs, the report questions wealthy countries’ continued “growth-based approach.” Instead, the authors call for striking a balance between economic, social and environmental aims, highlighting the importance of new policy choices moving forward.On policy options and institutional support to achieve SDG 8, the report highlights the importance of: national employment policies; labor standards and labor market institutions and their role in promoting inclusion, equity and security; and the social dialogue, partnerships and exchange of information needed to fulfill the ambitions of the Goal. These three areas, the report notes, are key to creating a “policy spiral.”The report concludes that an integrated policy agenda accounting for the dynamic interlinkages between SDG 8 and other Goals is required, and the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda can serve as a key reference point.

"25 September 2019: In parallel to the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, five organizations – Global Wildlife Conservation, Rainforest Foundation Norway, UN Development Programme (UNDP), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Resources Institute (WRI) – launched the ‘Forests for Life Partnership’ in recognition of forests as a nature-based solution to climate change and biodiversity protection.In launching the Partnership, the organizations highlighted how forests help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigate climate change, maintain regional rainfall patterns, and sustain the livelihoods and culture of indigenous peoples. Forests provide a home for 80% of the world’s land-based wildlife species. Despite the benefits they provide, less than 25% of the world’s forests are considered intact. According to WRI, these intact forests “are being damaged at twice the rate of forests overall,” from logging, demand for charcoal and fuel, land clearing for industrial agriculture and illegal hunting.The Forest for Life Partnership aims to “halt and reverse forest degradation across one billion hectares of the most intact forests worldwide” to achieve global climate, biodiversity and sustainable development targets. The Partnership will focus on the Amazon, Congo Basin, New Guinea and the northern boreal zone as well as smaller, intact forests across Mesoamerica, Madagascar, and South and Southeast Asia. Efforts will include engaging indigenous peoples in the management and conservation of forests and promoting policies to protect forests from degradation and fragmentation.The Partnership has committed US$50 million over the next five years to protect the world’s most intact forests and aims to mobilize an additional US$200 million from governments, foundations, corporations and individuals through a dedicated ‘Forests for Life Action Fund.’ One of the first commitments under the Partnership is the ‘5 Great Forests of Mesoamerica Initiative,’ though which Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, and the Dominican Republic will work together to address deforestation and support forest governance and forest-friendly livelihoods in the Maya, La Moskitia, Indio Maíz-Tortuguero and the Darién forests.This Partnership is one of several initiatives launched to support forest-centered nature-based solutions to climate change and other development challenges. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) also announced initiatives at the Climate Action Summit. FAO’s ‘Great Green Wall for Cities’ aims to green urban areas, integrating them into a continuum of restored landscapes. UNECE’s ‘Trees in Cities Challenge’ calls on mayors to make tree planting pledges towards reducing GHGs and improving their cities’ health and well-being.

"The African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change (AGN) issued a response to thedecisionto postpone the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC due to the global COVID-19 crisis. The statement emphasizes the vulnerability of African countries to the negative impacts of climate change, calls on developed countries to agree on a path forward to close the climate finance gap in 2020, and stresses the importance of holding COP 27 in 2021.Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, AGN Chair and Vice-President of the Bureau of COP/CMP/CMA, states that the AGN stands in solidarity with countries affected by COVID-19, and stresses the importance for all nations to continue to build momentum for ambitious climate action.Gahouma-Bekale highlights 2020 as “an important year for the completion of the rules of the Paris Agreement and the Communication of revised and updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as well as the start of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.” He laments the postponement due to COVID-19 of many events which are crucial to building political momentum before the sessions of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies and COP 26.The AGN emphasizes the urgency for all nations to take ambitious collective climate action at COP 26. Highlighting African countries’ particular vulnerability to the effects of climate change, the Group notes scientists have warned that the world has reached a “tipping point.”The AGN calls on developed countries to close the climate finance gap by the end of 2020 despite the postponement of the COP, in line with the commitment by developed countries to provide USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. However, the statement notes, aSeptember 2019 reportby the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that developed countries provided only USD 71.2 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2017.The AGN also maintains that the UNFCCC should hold COP 27 in Africa in 2021, as originally planned, stating that the timing of the COPs “must be linked to the urgent need of addressing the climate emergency.” [AGN Press Release] [SDG Knowledge Hub Sources]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law (RWI) has published a report on legal instruments and practice in Southeast Asia that support a right to a healthy environment. The authors find that countries in the region that recognize this right are in a better position to tackle environmental challenges.Launched on 1 December 2020, the report titled, ‘Prosperous and Green in the Anthropocene: The human right to a healthy environment in Southeast Asia,’ provides a detailed overview of specific laws, policies, and court decisions in member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that support the right to a healthy environment. It also proposes options for strengthening implementation.According to theUN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, this right includes the rights to clean air, a safe climate, access to safe water and adequate sanitation, healthy and sustainably produced food, non-toxic environments in which to work, study and play, and healthy biodiversity and ecosystems. In order to secure this right, people must have access to information, public participation in environmental decision making, and access to justice and effective remedies.The authors explain that recognizing the human right to a healthy environment helps ensure the conditions for continued sustainable development and prosperity. “The social-ecological crises we are experiencing do not affect all people in the same way,” and as countries seek to solve them, they need effective human rights and environmental legal and policy frameworks.ASEAN countries have several options to strengthen their right to a healthy environment, according to the report. First, they could adopt a regional instrument similar to the Escazu agreement adopted by Latin American and Caribbean countries, or become party to the Aarhus Convention, a European agreement that is now open to non-European Member States. ASEAN governments also could support integrating human rights into the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and other multilateral environmental agreements. Among other further options they could continue to support specialized environmental courts and national human rights institutions (NHRIs). [Publication:Prosperous and Green in the Anthropocene: The human right to a healthy environment in Southeast Asia] [Launch event recording]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Two civil society campaigns have released a joint communique on elements for the political declaration to be adopted at the UN’s 75th anniversary. This event should be “more than a birthday party,” the authors suggest, and the political declaration should go beyond “bland re-commitments to Charter principles plus recognition of previous accomplishments and already agreed goals.”Negotiations are underway on the political declaration among UN Member States. The text is expected to be adopted by world leaders at the high-level event to commemorate the anniversary in September 2020.The declaration should catalyze a formal, post-2020 review of the global governance architecture.The UN2020 Campaign and the Together First Network released the communique to UN Member States on 10 April 2020. The text emphasizes the need for three elements in the UN75 political declaration. First, it highlights calls for a formalized international process to strengthen multilateralism. The UN75 political declaration, therefore, should catalyze a post-2020 longer-term review of the global governance architecture, perhaps through the creation of a new independent commission or high-level panel.Second, it argues that the time has come for a system-wide review of the modalities for civil society participation. Over the past several years, civil society has “demonstrated its capacity to self-organize, and to partner with governments and the UN to deliver successful outcomes.” The authors note that communications innovations are allowing for greater participation, and a fairer and more democratic approach to incorporating peoples’ voices is possible.Third, on better funding the UN, the communique notes that contributions from Member States are assessed and allocated using an “arcane and opaque” set of rules, and this system has not generated adequate funding for the UN’s work. The text calls for the UN75 political declaration to mandate a wide-ranging review and reform of the means for providing essential funding of the UN system.The communique notes that the vital role of the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated how essential the UN system is for coordinating global policies and actions, providing reliable information, and setting standards for appropriate responses. The global financial and economic downturn associated with COVID-19 also reinforces the need for “new tools and approaches to cross-border cooperation in our hyperconnected world.”The civil society campaigns intend to launch a UN75 People’s Declaration and Plan of Action during the UN75 People’s Forum for the UN We Need. This event was originally scheduled for 23 April 2020 at UN Headquarters but converted to a multimedia global videoconference on 14 May 2020, due to COVID-19.

"UN Member States and officials are considering changes to the format of the UN General Debate for the 75th UN General Assembly session and the surrounding high-level meetings in September 2020. Officials expect that limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings may still be in effect in September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level week has been anticipated as the start of a “landmark year” for the UN.On 9 June 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bandecirculated“elements for consideration” regarding the revised format. The proposal is based on advice from the UN Secretary-General, the host government (US) and local authorities (New York City and New York State), Member States, and the UN’s medical director.Heads of States and Government would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements.According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020. On 22 September the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who waselected on 17 June– would deliver an opening statement in the UNGA Hall, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would present his annual report on the work of the organization. Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall. Alternatively, the New York-based Permanent Representative of a Member State could deliver a statement in person in the UNGA Hall.The physical presence of delegations in the UNGA Hall would be limited to at one delegate per Member States. This may be extended to two delegates, if possible. Everyone would be requested to wear a face covering at all times, maintain physical distancing, and be free of COVID-19 symptoms.Similar arrangements would be put in place for the high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020 (UN75).Other high-level meetings are currently scheduled to convene in parallel to the debate. Therefore, citing operational limitations on parallel meetings, Muhammad-Bande suggests changing their dates to allow for the use of virtual platforms and pre-recorded video statements. These meetings and their proposed rescheduled dates are:Summit on Biodiversity(proposed to reschedule to 30 September);High-level meeting on 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) (proposed to reschedule to 1 October); andHigh-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (proposed to reschedule to 2 October).The President notes that proceedings of the high-level week will be streamed live on UN WebTV and all statements made in any of the UN’s six official languages will be interpreted into the other five languages.In addition, he writes that “we will work to facilitate the meaningful participation of civil society.” Side events are encouraged to take place over virtual platforms only.Avirtual meetingto discuss the proposal took place on 12 June. Member States areinvitedto submit written comments by 19 June.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat has released the zero draft of the global biodiversity framework. The framework “builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020” and aims to bring about a “transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled.”The ‘Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’ requested at itsfirst meetingthat a zero draft text of the global biodiversity framework be provided six weeks prior toits second meeting, which will be held 24-28 February in Kunming, China.Speaking on the zero draft, the Open Working Group Co-chairs, Basile Van Havre and Francis Ogwal, pointed out that they, “tried to create a framework for all, one that sets the stage for an inspirational, ambitious, realistic, and achievable framework.”Theproposed framework, published on 13 January, comprises background information, an introduction, and a draft recommendation for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its next meeting. These are followed by two annexes the contain, respectively, the initial draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the consideration of the Working Group, and elements of a draft recommendation to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fifteenth meeting. The document is complemented by two addendums, containing appendices to the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework and a glossary of terms.The framework presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, and each of these goals has an associated outcome for 2030. The five goals address net loss and ecosystem resilience; reductions in the percentage of species threatened with extinction; the maintenance and enhancement of genetic diversity; the benefits of nature to people; and increasing the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five goals. The 20 targets are presented under the categories of reducing threats to biodiversity; meeting people’s needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing; and tools and solutions for implementation and mainstreaming.The draft includes a preliminary list of indicators that may be used to assess progress towards the goals and targets. It considers elements of guidance on goals, SMART targets, indicators, baselines, and monitoring frameworks, relating to the drivers of biodiversity loss and for achieving transformational change. It also “takes into account the various consultation processes that have been undertaken, including the views expressed during the informal briefing by the Co-Chairs on 24 November 2019, which presented a preliminary overview of the zero draft of the framework.”The Open-Ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework was tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. This process is expected to lead to the adoption of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework at theUN Biodiversity Conference, which is set to convene in October 2020, in Kunming, China.

She called for integrating VLRs into the VNR process. Representatives from a number of communities that have developed VLRs discussed their experiences. The communities include: New York City, Madrid, Moscow, Oaxaca, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Barcelona.UN-Habitat announced that, in collaboration with the Madrid City Council, UN-Habitat will organize an Expert Group Meeting on strengthening the VLR process by the end of 2020.Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:‘State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs‘, a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020 prepared by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES); and‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’ which provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation.[UCLG Website] [Guidelines for Voluntary Local Reviews: Volume 1] [ENB Coverage of the Side Event]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
"The European Commission has adopted a decision establishing the EU-wide quantity of allowances to be issued during the fourth phase of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), running from 2021-2030. The sectors covered by the EU ETS must reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels to achieve the EU’s 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of at least 40% from 1990 levels.TheCommission Decisionof 16 November 2020 considers the following aspects in the determination for the cap for 2021:A 0.46% increase of the linear reduction factor from 1.74 % to 2.2 %, which determines the amount by which the cap will decrease each year;The implications of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, including that from 1 January 2021, theEU ETS Directivecovers the emissions from electricity generation in Northern Ireland, while the emissions from the UK are no longer accounted for;The latest scientific data concerning the global warming potential (GWP) of GHGs; andThe exclusion from the EU ETS of small installations by Croatia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain.According to an EU press release, the cap for 2021 does not include the quantity of allowances to be issued in respect of aircraft operators, which is “the result of a bottom-up approach starting from free allocation to aviation.”Following theappointment of the European Energy Exchangeas the EU ETS common auction platform from 2021, the EU expects to publish the 2021 auction calendars in December 2020.

"16 September 2019: In advance of Climate Week NYC 2019 and the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, Unilever announced that it has achieved 100% renewable energy in its factories, warehouses, distribution centers, offices, data facilities and research and development facilities across five continents. This achievement is a “significant step” towards Unilever’s target of becoming a carbon-neutral company before 2030.Unilever has achieved 100% renewable energy through supporting the development of local renewable energy markets. Thirty-eight percent of the company’s grid electricity is supplied through corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green electricity targets. Unilever has worked with partners around the world to generate renewable energy at its own sites, and uses solar power at Unilever facilities in 18 countries. When it has not been feasible to use this approach, Unilever purchased Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which are openly-traded certificates linked to the generation of renewable energy.In addition, Unilever invested in energy efficiency programmes, which has reduced their total energy consumption by 28%. The company emphasized that it has had no net on-costs to achieve renewable energy.Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel, said the “climate emergency is one of the most urgent challenges we’re all facing.” He said Unilever has worked hard accelerate the delivery of its 100% renewable energy targets by securing “renewable energy contracts for our sites across five continents.” Engel expressed hope that Unilever’s announcement “will inspire further action elsewhere and help to prove that it is possible to combat the climate crisis.”Unilever took part in the Climate Action Summit, where it advocated for the importance of limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

"The Dutch highest court upheld the previous decisions in the ‘Urgenda Climate Case,’ a lawsuit originally brought by a Dutch environmental group Urgenda, on behalf of 886 citizens, against the Government. The court concluded that the Dutch Government has an obligation to urgently and significantly reduce emissions in accordance with its human rights obligations.The Supreme Court of the Netherlands agreed with the lower courts’ order requiring the Dutch Government to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a minimum of 25% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, a target more ambitious than the one the Dutch State has under EU law (a 20% reduction by 2020 compared to 1990 levels). The court based its judgment on the UNFCCC and on the Dutch State’s legal duties to protect the life and well-being of citizens in the Netherlands, in line with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).The Supreme Court found that, given the “large degree of consensus in the scientific and international community on the urgent need for developed countries to reduce GHG emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020,” the Dutch State “has not explained why a lower reduction would be justified and could still lead, on time, to the final target accepted by the Dutch State.”The ruling provides a clear path forward for concerned individuals in Europe – and around the world – to undertake climate litigation in order to protect human rights.The Court rejected the Dutch State’s claim that it is up to politicians to decide on the reduction of GHG emissions, highlighting the Dutch courts’ role to apply the provisions of the ECHR and to offer legal protection as an essential element of a democracy under the rule of law. This approach is different from the one taken by several courts in the US where the “political question doctrine” has repeatedlybarredthe judiciary from deciding on issues perceived as “patently political” and “transcendently legislative.”The international significance of the decision, described by many as “historic,” has been confirmed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, who “welcomed the Court’s acceptance that human rights obligations are central to the response to … climate change.” “This landmark ruling provides a clear path forward for concerned individuals in Europe – and around the world – to undertake climate litigation in order to protect human rights,” Bachelet said.The 20 December 2019 Supreme Court’s ruling is the final judgment in the Urgenda Climate Case. It comes less than a week after the UN Climate Change Conference in Madridfailed to deliverthe ambitious outcome needed to address the climate crisis, and less than a month after the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)confirmedthat emissions reductions must be increased at least fivefold to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

"This story was updated on 1 November 2019On 30 October, the President of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, announced the Government of Chile’s decision not to host the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, “taking into consideration the difficult circumstances in the country.” The Santiago Climate Change Conference was scheduled to take place from 2-13 December 2019, in Santiago, Chile.In addition to 25th session of the the Conference of the Parties (COP 25), the 15th session of the COP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 15), the second session of the COP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 2), and the 51st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 51) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 51) were expected to convene in the Chilean capital.The announcement came fewer than five weeks before the scheduled opening of the Conference. On 1 November, the UNFCCC announced that the Bureau of the COP had accepted the proposal from the Government of Chile, as incoming COP Presidency, to hold COP 25 in Madrid, Spain, “following the generous offer” from the Government of Spain.The Climate Change Conference is the main climate event of the year. Momentum for COP 25 has been building throughout 2019, notably at theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, which sought to “mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels to advance climate action” and catalyze ambition.In 2020, countries are expected to submit their revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term low-emission development strategies to the UNFCCC. COP 25 is scheduled to take stock of climate action implementation and ambition before 2020. Negotiations on issues relating to Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches), including the unresolved elements of the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) such as a market mechanism and a non-market mechanism, outstanding since COP 24, are expected to conclude in Madrid.

"Ten families from within and outside Europe are taking the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to the European General Court, asserting that their livelihoods are at risk as a result of the EU’s failure to adequately address climate change.Referred to as the ‘People’s Climate Case,’ the lawsuit declares that, among other aspects, the EU’s existing 2030 climate target is inadequate to prevent dangerous climate change and protect their rights to life, health, occupation and property.The families, plaintiffs in the case, come from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Kenya, Fiji and the Swedish Sami Youth Association Sáminuorra. Their claim, based on an assessment that climate change is already impacting their livelihoods, homes, traditional family occupation and culture, calls on the EU to define a higher emission reduction target to protect citizens’ fundamental rights, justified by the requirements of higher rank EU and international law.The case asserts that the level of greenhouse gases (GHGs) permitted through recently approved EU emission regulation legal acts do not represent the EU’s highest level of ambition according to its potential to reduce emissions, claiming that an acceptable level of emissions reduction should be substantially higher than 40% by 2030.The People’s Climate Case has drawn support from a variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), scientists and citizens, including German NGO Protect the Planet, which is bearing costs related to the legal case. Research think tank Climate Analytics has provided scientific materials evidencing the ways in which the families are impacted by climate change as well as what can be done to reduce emissions beyond the current EU 2030 target.The case is also supported by Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, Europe’s largest NGO coalition working on climate and energy issues with more than 150 member organizations. Wendel Trio, Director of CAN Europe, said the case underscores the urgency and necessity for the EU to increase its 2030 climate target to respect the commitments taken in the Paris Agreement on climate change, including the agreement to pursue efforts to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5ºC.The People’s Climate Case follows a rising number of climate change litigation cases around the world, as previously reported by the SDG Knowledge Hub.

"30 August 2019: The Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) highlighted business-based innovative solutions for inclusive and sustainable economic and social transformation in Africa, and for meeting climate goals and the SDGs. The gathering revealed that, despite progress made on the SDGs in Africa, which has six out of the world’s ten fastest growing economies, a funding gap remains, with an estimated USD 600 billion and 1.2 trillion per year required to implement the SDGs.The conference convened under the theme, ‘Advancing Africa’s Development Through People, Technology and Innovation,’ in Yokohama, Japan, from 28-30 August 2019. It was organized by UNDP, the Government of Japan, the African Union Commission (AUC) and the World Bank.Addressing the conference, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that “little undermines development like disaster,” which can wipe out decades of Africa’s sustainable development gains overnight, citing deadly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in early 2019 as one example of a disaster made worse by climate change. He supported Africa’s right to ask big emitters like China, the US and India to reduce their emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Guterres said that, throughout Africa, long-term drought is causing insecurity, for example in the Sahel, and emphasized the economic benefits of investing in climate-resilient infrastructure with its 4 to 1 benefit-cost ratio.Little undermines development like disaster, which can wipe out decades of Africa’s sustainable development gains overnight.Speaking to participants, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator Achim Steiner emphasized the private sector’s role in Africa’s development and in realizing the SDGs, and the importance of economic transformation through innovation and business, sustainable and resilient society, and peace and stability. He stressed the need to harness digital technologies to allow for better access to information and finance so that even those furthest behind can benefit from technological innovations.The conference endorsed the ‘Yokohama Declaration 2019,’ which addresses achievements, outstanding issues and continued collaboration and actions to advance progress related to TICAD7’s three pillars: accelerating economic transformation through innovation and private sector engagement; increasing the sustainability and resilience of society; and strengthening peace and stability. The accompanyingYokohama Plan of Actions 2019lists actions expected to be implemented by TICAD partners to promote the three pillars.To enhance partnerships between the Japanese and African private sectors and to generate business-based solutions for the SDGs, UNDP launched two partnership frameworks during the conference: a tripartite partnership with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Japan External Trade Organization focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and a bilateral partnership with Japan Association of Corporate Executives to increase engagement of the Japanese business community in Africa. UNDP Administrator Steiner also signed a partnership framework for cooperation with Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, to accelerate local government engagement towards achieving the SDGs.TICAD is a multi-stakeholder platform for discussing issues relevant to and advancing Africa’s development.

"A report published by the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) and the Strategic Alliance for International Chemicals Management (SAICM) illustrates the impact of chemicals on women, as well as gender inequalities in decision-making on chemicals and waste management. The report suggests concrete steps to protect women’s health and their decision-making role.The report titled, ‘Gender Review Mapping with a Focus on Women and Chemicals: Impact of Emerging Policy Issues and the Relevance for the Sustainable Development Goals,’ discusses the disproportionate impact on women of exposure throughout the chemicals lifecycle. For example, women are exposed to hazardous chemicals more than men during: the production of electronics; use, through lead in paint and chemicals in toys; and after use and at the end of product life, such as when gathering crops or clean­ing used pesticide containers.Women are also disproportionately exposed to hazardous chemicals when extracting metals from devices in electronic waste, and they can experience impacts on reproductive and pregnancy outcomes long after exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Information is lacking on the impacts of women of pharmaceuticals in the environment and nanomaterials.To address these inequalities, the report highlights a range of activities, including:Strengthening the gender links with sound chemicals and waste management, including by addressing women and chemicals in the SAICM Beyond 2020 process;Additional analysis of the global burden of disease related to women and chemicals and their integral role in chemicals and waste management; andIncreased efforts to ensure “women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all decision-making levels in political, economic and public life.”While the 2030 Agenda does not include a stand-alone Goal on chemicals and waste management, the report explains, it is critical to achieving several SDGs including SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 5 (gender equality), which itself is considered a prerequisite for reaching most of the other Goals.In December 2017, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and IPEN signed a Memorandum of Understanding to partner on gender and chemicals work focused on: raising awareness of the impact on women and children to health effects linked to chemical exposures, including creating opportunities for training and experience sharing and collecting sex-disaggregated data; promoting women’s engagement and leadership in decision-making processes at the local, national and global levels; and implementing and contributing to activities related to SAICM Emerging Policy Issues and other Issues of Concern as well as related SDGs and chemicals conventions.

"15 August 2019: The World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) have published a joint report that draws on their work in water management systems in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The report highlights water as a ‘risk multiplier’ in the region, given that competition over scarce water resources is likely to exacerbate conflict.The authors propose that sustainable, long-term management of water resources can also be a pathway to peace, and that the SDGs can provide a framework to promote long-lasting solutions to water and fragility challenges.The report, titled ‘Water Management in Fragile Systems: Building Resilience to Shocks and Protracted Crises in The Middle East and North Africa’, argues that water is “the common currency that links nearly every SDG,” including, SDG 6 on water and sanitation and those that address food security (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), energy (SDG 7), jobs (SDG 8), social equity (SDG 10) ecosystem services (SDGs 13, 14 and 15), and peace and justice (SDG 16). Thus, it suggests that effective action on water resources has great potential to bring peace and stability. The report calls for increasing efforts to manage water resources sustainably and efficiently, ensuring that water services are reliable and reach everyone, and protecting all populations from water-related catastrophes.The authors recommend using decentralized, participatory approaches to water and related agricultural issues, noting that leadership is important at all levels, and that responses should include dialogue with local communities and “whatever local government may exist on the ground.” They also call for investing in innovative policies and practices that can contribute to crop productivity and the efficiency of water use, including measures to promote the resilience of rain-fed agricultural systems, for example, through land conservation and reclamation. They urge transboundary cooperation, especially in view of the small size of many MENA countries and their shared water resources.The authors make comparisons with water governance reforms implemented in Australia in response to the country’s water crisis, including the creation of a federal water department and legislation, establishment of an independent authority for the Murray-Darling Basin, investment in water science and water data, and independent oversight.Overall, the report highlights that daily activities related to the use of water resources in growing food, generating rural employment, providing food for households and producing and selling food, generating rural incomes and employment, rebuilding household-level food security, supplying drinking water, and rebuilding social cohesion have great potential for stabilizing fragile conditions and promoting peace.

"16 July 2019: The Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Violence against Children launched a report addressing SDG target 16.2, which calls for ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against children. Goal 16 is being reviewed during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) taking place from 9-18 July 2019, in New York, US.Thereporttitled, ‘Keeping the Promise: Ending Violence Against Children,’ was launched on 16 July 2019 during a panel, moderated by Najat Maalla M’jid, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Violence against Children. Thelaunch eventtook place on the sidelines of the HLPF.Per the report, at least one billion children experience violence every year. Children also account for 30% of those who are trafficked, and refugee and migrant children often find that violence is a “constant companion,” as it drives them from their home countries, accompanies them on their journey, and waits for them at their destination, the authors write.On progress, the report indicates that almost 100 countries have comprehensive policies in place to prevent and respond to violence against children, and around 60 countries have comprehensive legislation to ban violence against children in all its forms. Among other initiatives, the report also notes that most of the 20 countries participating in the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR) Beyond Detention Strategy 2014-2019 have improved their legal and policy frameworks, and the detention of refugee and migrant children is now prohibited by law in Lithuania, Malta, Mexico and the UK.On challenges, the report cites scarce and fragmented data, including a lack of information on violence against children on the move and the sexual exploitation of boys, and weak child protection systems in many countries.The report identifies five ingredients for success. For maximum impact, they must be combined, it says. The ingredients are:committed political leadership, strong policy frameworks and legislation, backed by predictable resources for implementation and enforcement;comprehensive, cross-sectoral approaches, and a preventive and a protective safety net for all children;robust evidence and data to address the drivers of violence;partnership and alliances to strengthen a “growing movement for children’s freedom from violence”; andmaking the voice of children heard.The year 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, an international legal framework to protect children’s rights. The Convention is considered as the most widely ratified international human rights treaty.

"The Adaptation Fund received new pledges from several contributor governments totaling nearly USD 116 million. The pledges coincided with the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement andClimate Ambition Summit 2020.The Adaptation Fund Board had raised its resource mobilization target for 2020 by 30% to USD 120 million in November to account for its USD 280 million active project pipeline. With the new pledges, the Fund closed out the year just shy of that target, but stated that this total represents “a remarkable effort during a challenging economic year ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.”Germany was the Fund’s largest contributor at EUR 50 million. Italy contributed EUR 30 million. Sweden contributed USD 15.2 million, a quarter of its four-year pledge made in 2019. Additionally, Belgium’s Walloon Regional Government contributed EUR 3.8 million, and Brussels-Capital Regional Government contributed EUR 185,000.On 14 December, the Fund held avirtual Contributor Dialogue for Ambition in Adaptation Finance. Ministers and high-level government officials gathered with national implementing entities and civil society representatives to recognize the Fund’s continued deliverance of adaptation projects, building of country ownership through the Direct Access modality, and expansion and adaptation of its work despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.In expressing his appreciation for the new pledges and previous contributions, Ibila Djibril, Chair, Adaptation Fund Board, stated that the Fund “continues to grow, with 115 projects in more than 100 countries serving 27 million total beneficiaries.” “Many projects are creating scalable models,” he said, and many projects are “adapting directly to help vulnerable communities build resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic, both to climate change, as well as health, environmental and economic risks.”Established under the Kyoto Protocol and supervised and managed by the Adaptation Fund Board, the Adaptation Fund has committed USD 778 million for climate change adaptation and resilience projects and programs since 2010, including 114 localized adaptation projects in the most vulnerable communities of developing countries with over 9 million direct beneficiaries.

"On the 30-year mark of a European convention on environmental governance, parties committed to helping countries achieve a sustainable and green recovery from COVID-19. The Vilinius Declaration was adopted by parties to the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention).Over 200 government officials, including several ministers and vice ministers, and representatives from international organizations, civil society, and academia attended the virtual Meetings of the Parties (MoP) to the Espoo Convention and its Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment. The meetings took place from 8-11 December 2020. The UNECE secretariat co-organized the event with Lithuania.Parties adopted guidance on the Convention’s applicability to nuclear power plants.In astatement, UN Secretary-General António Guterres recognized the Espoo Convention as the “first international treaty to have specific procedural rights and duties of Parties regarding the transboundary impacts of certain activities on the environment.” He described the Convention as “among the pioneers” in advancing public rights to access information and participate, “promoting transparent, inclusive and accountable environmental governance.” The Secretary-General highlighted the Convention as a “tangible tool” to support progress on the SDGs and contribute to a green, sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.Participants highlighted the Convention’s “practical rules” for domestic action and international cooperation to prevent, reduce, and control adverse transboundary impacts from planned activities as a milestone in promoting sustainable development and shaping international laws. Delegates recognized the ways in which the Convention’s detailed provisions for providing information to and consulting with authorities has contributed to improving environmental governance, transparency in decision-making and planning, and the quality of information.Delegates adopted a strategic vision and identified operational priorities, agreed on three-year workplans, and adopted guidance on a number of topics, including on compliance and the Convention’s applicability to nuclear power plants.The Declaration adopted during the meetings reaffirms Parties commitment to fully implement and comply with the Convention and its Protocol, and to employ strategic environmental assessments (SEA) and environmental impact assessments (EIA) to help countries to achieve a sustainable and green post-COVID-19 economic recovery.The Espoo Convention is the only UN instrument that offers a legal framework to ensure international cooperation in assessing and managing environmental impacts of planned activities, in particular in a transboundary context.

"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has developed a “COVID-19 Policy Tracker,” which summarizes the economic responses that governments are taking to address the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Policy Tracker includes information on 193 economies, as of 3 April 2020. For each of these 193 entities, data regarding number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and containment measures are updated regularly, as are summaries of each economy’s fiscal, monetary and macro-financial, and exchange rate and balance of payments policy responses.The Tracker focuses on discretionary actions; it does not incorporate information such as automatic insurance mechanisms or social safety nets that were in place prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The IMF notes that the information in the Tracker is not meant for comparisons across economies, because responses vary depending on the nature of the shock and country-specific circumstances.In a separatearticle, the IMF recommends that economic policy at this time should have three objectives: guarantee the functioning of essential sectors; provide enough resources for people hit by the crisis; and prevent excessive economic disruption. The article notes that, while public sector intervention is justified by the emergency “for as long as exceptional circumstances persist,” it must be provided in a transparent manner and should have clear sunset clauses.On fiscal policy recommendations, and IMFarticlesuggests that governments should: spend money to prevent, detect, control, treat, and contain the virus, and to provide basic services to people that have to be quarantined and to the businesses affected; provide timely, targeted, and temporary cash flow relief to the people and firms that are most affected; and create a business continuity plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The International Labour Organization (ILO) and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have published a study, predicting a net growth of 15 million new jobs by 2030 in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) if countries in the region adopt net-zero carbon emissions policies. The report highlights the importance for governments to hold social dialogue with the private sector and trade unions to ensure that a transition to net-zero emissions creates decent jobs and aligns with the SDGs.The report titled, ‘Jobs in a Net-zero Emissions Future in Latin America and the Caribbean,’ recognizes that dependence on fossil fuel exports, current prevailing work deficits, and inequalities have made the LAC region particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, similarly, to future impacts of climate change. The publication finds that the agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, waste management, tourism, and construction industries hold the potential to create decent jobs and, with adequate measures, to ensure “that those who lose out in the transition are protected and supported,” while contributing to climate action, boosting growth, tackling inequality, and advancing the SDGs.The report acknowledges that net jobs “mask winners and losers.” While 22.5 million jobs are expected to be created in LAC’s agriculture and plant-based food production, renewable electricity, forestry, construction, and manufacturing, a just transition would eliminate 7.5 million jobs in fossil fuel electricity generation, fossil fuel extraction, and animal-based food production industries.The report highlights the importance of retraining and on-the-job training programmes to prepare workers for the transition from carbon-intensive sectors, including gaining new skills to cope with climate change impacts. New low- and medium-skill jobs will also benefit a portion of the 66 million people in the region currently being underutilized in the labor market, including the 9 million youth who are unemployed, according to the report. The report warns, however, that 80% of the new jobs would be in male-dominated sectors, so women would not benefit from job creation “unless the current gender segregation by occupation is addressed.”In seeking to provide a blueprint for countries to create decent jobs, the report makes a number of recommendations, including: extending social protection coverage, unemployment benefits, and access to health care; improving agricultural risk management programmes; enhancing occupational safety and health measures; and improving producers’ access to markets and integration into supply chains. [Publication:Jobs in a Net-zero Emissions Future in Latin America and the Caribbean] [IDB Publication Landing Page] [ILO News Release]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"The UN has launched the first phase of the 2020 peacebuilding architecture review, which is mandated by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council. At a meeting convened by the UN Peacebuilding Commission on 22 November 2019, governments exchanged views on the UN’s work in peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized the need to improve resources for the peacebuilding system.On 7 October 2019, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bandecirculateda proposal for the scope, terms of reference and modalities for the 2020 review. Heannouncedthe launch of the informal phase of the review process on 31 October 2019, which is expected to last until the second quarter of 2020. For the second phase, the Presidents of the UNGA and the Security Council will appoint two co-facilitators to lead intergovernmental consultations on an outcome document to be submitted to UNGA and the UN Security Council.On 22 November 2019,addressingthe meeting of the Peacebuilding Commission, Guterres cautioned that current low levels of funding for the UN Peacebuilding Fund render current peacebuilding work unsustainable. He reported that while contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund have increased modestly, demands for support “have grown exponentially,” leaving many requests for investments in critical situations “unanswered.” Warning that the Peacebuilding Fund will have to slow down without significant changes in its funding situation, he called for a “quantum leap” in support from governments towards the Fund’s objective of 500 USD million per year.Guterres also cautioned about a lack of coordination and fragmentation, explaining that inadequate, earmarked and siloed financing can drive parts of the UN apart. He said the 2020 review is an opportunity to improve the system and its resources.According to aNote to Correspondents, Member States also expressed concern about funding constraints. Some noted that the Peacebuilding Fund has had to postpone urgent investments, including in support of meaningful participation of women and youth in peacebuilding processes, due to resource shortages.Among other messages expressed during the initial meeting, governments said the review process should:consider ways to strengthen the UN’s peacebuilding work “based on field-driven analysis and nationally owned initiatives”;address the need to continue strengthening the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, including to increase coherence and coordination across the UN’s operational pillars, taking into account the ongoing reforms of the UN; andsupport continued progress in the Peacebuilding Commission’s advisory role to the UNGA and Security Council.The UN Secretary-General informed Member States that his 2020 report on peacebuilding, which will serve as the principal input for the review process, will focus on the UN’s impact in the field.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"5 July 2019: Water Europe has put forward recommendations on the role that the EU, the European Commission and science, civil society and industry actors in the water sector can play in contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its report, published in partnership with the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), highlights the potential for information technology, social innovation, and business action on water stewardship to achieve water-related targets in Europe and beyond.The report titled, ‘Water in the 2030 Agenda: How Can Europe Act?’ outlines existing EU frameworks for water governance, and the Union’s achievements on water-related targets, especially on sanitation access, freshwater quality, and sustainable use of water resources. It also provides case examples of companies or projects that illustrate the kinds of progress being made.If we do not solve water challenges now, the very basis of well-being and growth in Europe and the world are at risk.The authors highlight many areas of innovation, including the possibilities for data-driven and process-based models and artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor water resources, and for European technologies and practices to be adapted and tailored to the needs of other countries with differing capacities and governance structures. They call for promoting open sharing of data and citizen engagement in data collection, and encourage companies to scale up their water stewardship action through engagement with governments, communities, other companies, and the financial sector. The authors also highlight the need for water awareness campaigns that result in improved knowledge, greater involvement of stakeholders, and changes in business and financing practices.The report draws attention to the risk posed by water insecurity as a driver of social unrest and migration. The authors warn that, “If we do not solve water challenges now, the very basis of well-being and growth in Europe and the world are at risk.”The report was presented at the Water Innovation Europe 2019 event, which took place in Brussels, Belgium, from 12-13 June 2019.Water Europe is a membership-based multi-stakeholder platform for water sector actors, which aims to achieve “a European water-smart society.” The platform, initially established by the EU, is in the process of organizing a series of International Water Dialogues with EU partner countries to offer European experience and know-how to international research and business collaboration, in partnership with UNESCO’s World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP).

"An issue brief from IDDRI (Sustainable Development and International Relations) suggests avenues for more efficient financing processes for the 2030 Agenda, particularly in the context of the vulnerabilities highlighted by the COVID-19 crisis. It argues that the “true test” of 2030 Agenda financing is not how much is invested in projects on one or more of the 169 SDG targets, but whether projects are designed to minimize the negative externalities and maximize the positive externalities across multiple Goals and targets.Authors Maria Alejandra Riaño and Damien Barchiche explain that synergies among SDGs and their targets “do not occur automatically.” As shown by the ongoing pandemic, one missing element such as efficient governance, health system, energy provision, or management of natural resources—can have effects throughout the economy and society.This is related to the growing risk of “SDG-washing,” the authors suggest. Understanding the actual impact of investment flows is particularly important during a crisis. They report that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on several initiatives to help map financing flows to the SDGs and assess remaining needs and gaps.With regard to country-level financing, the brief recommends developing Integrated National Financing Frameworks, as agreed by UN Member States in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development. The Frameworks would spell out financing and implementation plans for the national sustainable development strategy, thus providing investors with clarity and predictability “across the three time horizons of relief, recovery and long-term structural transformation.”The issue brief titled, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: prerequisites, and opportunities for the post-Covid-19 crisis,’ sayseffectively implementing and financing the 2030 Agenda requires “forceful” alliances and partnerships that are grounded in local and national needs and capabilities, invest heavily upfront, invest in innovation and use science-based solutions, and have the support and participation of government authorities. [Publication:Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Prerequisites, and Opportunities for the Post-Covid-19 Crisis]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Equitable access to water and sanitation is still a challenge for Europe, according to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO)-UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). Thirty-one million people in Europe do not have access to basic sanitation, 48 million people do not have piped water at home, and more than 300,000 people still practice open defecation, mainly in the countryside. The JMP is reporting its findings in the lead-up to the 10th anniversary of the Protocol on Water and Health, an international instrument supported by UNECE and WHO-Europe.UN agencies launched the report titled ‘The Human Rights to Water and Sanitation in Practice: Findings and lessons learned from the work on equitable access to water and sanitation under the Protocol on Water and Health in the pan-European region’ at the 5th session of the Meeting of the Parties (MOP-5) to the Protocol. The findings were generated through self-assessment by 11 countries that UNECE and WHO-Europe support to implement the Protocol: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, North Macedonia, Moldova, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Ukraine. The report notes that the Protocol acts as a mechanism for implementing the SDGs, particularly SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, and countries have been involved in developing and applying guidance and tools to support equitable access to water and sanitation.There is “a long way to go” on action to improve equitable access to water and sanitation.Some of the findings reported by countries in their self-assessment include a lack of human rights awareness among public officials, discrimination against Roma minorities, and lack of facilities for menstrual hygiene at public venues. UNECEnotedthere is “a long way to go” on action to improve equitable access to water and sanitation, which would promote achievement of SDG targets 6.1 on clean water and 6.2 on sanitation.Countries have taken concrete measures to achieve the Protocol, for example:Hungary amended its National Building Code to reflect minimum requirements and standards for access to water and sanitation in buildings;France and Portugal included provisions to ensure affordability of water and sanitation services in law or policy;North Macedonia is improving menstrual hygiene facilities in cafes, bars and restaurants in the city Skopje; andthe city of Castelló in Spain has installed seven new public drinking water fountains.To promote equitable access, the report recommends that countries: reduce geographical differences in the services provided; prevent discrimination or exclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups in the provision of services; and ensure financial affordability of services.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"16 September 2019: The world celebrated the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer under the theme, ‘32 Years and Healing.’ The theme recognizes more than three decades of international cooperation to protect the ozone layer and the climate, and highlights the need to maintain momentum to ensure healthy people and a healthy planet.Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) allow ultraviolet (UV) rays to reach the earth, increasing the incidents of skin cancers, eye cataracts and compromised immune systems and causing harm to forests and agricultural lands. The Day highlighted the role of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in the phase-out of 99% of ODS in air conditioners, refrigerators and other products. As a result of these actions, the 2018 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion found that parts of the ozone layer have recovered between 1% and 3% per decade since 2000. At projected rates, the Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitude ozone are expected to heal completely by the 2030s, while the Southern Hemisphere is anticipated to recover by the 2050s, and the Polar Regions by 2060s. In addition, efforts to protect the ozone layer have helped to avert an estimated 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) emissions between 1990-2010.As we rightly focus our energies on tackling climate change, the world must be careful not to neglect the ozone layer.The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) celebrated these successes on the Day while calling for “remaining vigilant and tackling any illegal sources of ODS as they arise.” UNEP also emphasized the importance of implementing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which focuses on phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Implementing the Kigali Amendment will help to continue ozone layer protection while also contributing to avoiding global temperature rise and ensuring that efforts to regenerate the ozone layer continue to support climate action.In his message for the Day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres highlighted the Montreal Protocol as an “inspirational example” of how humanity is capable of cooperating to address a global challenge as well as a “key instrument for tackling today’s climate crisis.” Guterres commended the 81 nations that have ratified the Kigali Amendment, and called on all other countries to ratify and implement the Amendment, declaring that implementing the Amendment “will be front and center for climate action” and meeting all the SDGs. Guterres concluded that, as we “rightly focus our energies on tackling climate change,” the world “must be careful not to neglect the ozone layer” and must stay alert to the threat posed by illegal use of ODS, including through improved regulations and enforcement and continued monitoring and reporting systems.

"September 2019: In a briefing note, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has assessed the readiness of 159 countries to leave no one behind (LNOB), using its 2019 LNOB index. The 159 countries include 87 countries that presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018, and 72 countries that presented or will present their VNRs in 2019 and 2020.Resource challenges beset readiness aspects, not only outcomes, of the 2030 Agenda.The 159 countries assessed include 24 low-income countries, 41 lower middle-income countries, 45 upper- middle-income countries, and 49 high-income countries. They were evaluated using three thematic components of the 2019 LNOB index, namely:Data – to assesses whether countries are undertaking the surveys necessary to identify those at high risk of being left behind;Policy – to assess whether countries have key policies in place to address the needs of those at risk of being left behind (such as women’s access to land, anti-discrimination labor laws and universal access to health); andFinance – to determine whether governments invest adequately in education, health and social protection, which are three sectors key to supporting those at high risk of being left behind.Thenote, written by Soumya Chattopadhyay and Stephanie Manea, finds that 81 countries are ready to meet their LNOB commitment, 54 are partially ready and 12 are not ready. In addition, data are insufficient for assessing 12 countries.The authors also find that most high- and upper-middle-income countries have already achieved “ready” status, but lower-middle- and low-income countries are lagging behind. They argue that this highlights a resource challenge that besets both readiness and outcome aspects of the 2030 Agenda.The note also concludes that:The readiness status of 12 countries has worsened, compared to ODI’s 2018 LNOB assessment, while only six have improved;On the data, policy and finance components measured, 102 countries are data-ready, while only 47 countries are ready in the policy dimension, and 45 in the finance dimension; andFollowing the 2018 index, most improvements are seen in the data dimension, and reflect an increase in the availability of household survey data.Before the release of the 2019 edition of the index, the 2018 version and an accompanying briefing note werelaunchedin the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2019.

"19 June 2019: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published a reflection on gaps and asymmetries in teachers’ training in information and communication technologies (ICT) across OECD countries, as well as changes to class composition and curricula brought by migration. The report argues that investing in teachers’ training and integrating global issues in curricula will be essential to ensure quality education for youth, to equip them with the skills they will need to adapt to the fast-changing, globalized job market.The report is based on the third edition of the OECD’s Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), which aims to help strengthen the knowledge and skills of the teaching workforce and to support its professionalism. The third edition of the TALIS features insights from 260,000 teachers and school leaders at 15,000 primary, lower and upper-secondary schools from 48 OECD countries and economies. The survey analyzed professionalism by exploring five pillars: the knowledge and skills required to teach; the perceived prestige of the profession; career opportunities; the collaborative culture among teachers; and the level of professional responsibility and autonomy of teachers and school leaders.Just over half of teachers across OECD countries received training in the use of ICT for teaching as part of their formal education or training.The publication, titled ‘Teachers and School Leaders as Lifelong Learners’, focuses on the knowledge and skills required to teach. The report notes that just over half of teachers (56 percent) across OECD countries received training in the use of ICT for teaching as part of their formal education or training, and less than half of teachers felt well prepared when they joined the profession. ICT training is lowest in Sweden (37 percent) and Spain (38 percent) and highest in Chile (77 percent) and Mexico (77 percent). About 18 percent of teachers across the OECD express a high need for professional development in ICT skills for teaching. However, the vast majority of teachers and school leaders who participated in the survey said that their schools are open to innovative practices and have the capacity to adopt them.The report also found that migration flows have changed the makeup of classrooms. Almost one-third of teachers in OECD countries work in schools where refugees make up at least one percent of the student population, and 17 percent of teachers work in schools where at least 10 percent of students have a migrant background. The majority of school leaders (95 percent) report that their teachers believe that children and young people should learn about commonalities among people of different cultures and state that they teach their students how to deal with ethnic and cultural discrimination. In addition, 80 percent of teachers report working in schools that have integrated global issues throughout the curriculum.

"27 September 2019: The OceanObs’19 Conference agreed on a consensus declaration with actions to guide the field of ocean observation and complement the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).It highlighted the need for “more complete and sustained observations in the ocean globally” to ensure an integrated ocean observing system that contributes to better understanding the environment and the climate, informing adaptation strategies and promoting the sustainable use of ocean resources.Over 1,200 experts from 60 countries participated in OceanObs’19, which convened from 16-20 September in Honolulu, Hawaii. The event focused on the theme, ‘An Ocean of Opportunity’ and aimed to facilitate discussion on progress in ocean observing networks and innovative solutions to society’s increasing needs for ocean information. In advance of the conference, authors from around the world wrote and published 140 community white papers in the open-access journal Frontiers in Marine Science. These papers formed the basis for the conference’s 24 breakout sessions.In an outcome statement, participants acknowledge that information about the ocean is necessary to advance understanding of the ocean system; inform efforts to conserve life in the sea for the benefits of future generations; mitigate the risk of disasters, including those related to a changing climate; reduce pollution and harmful debris; and strengthen security and safety at sea. Participants encourage a “collective effort to evolve ocean observing to generate the data and information we need for the ocean we want.” In particular, participants call for,inter alia:engaging a wide range of stakeholders in the planning, implementation and review of an integrated and effective ocean observing systems;focusing the ocean observing system on addressing critical human needs, scientific understanding of the ocean and linkages to the climate system, real time ocean observation services and promotion of policies that sustain a healthy, biologically diverse and resilient ocean ecosystem;advancing the frontiers of ocean observing capabilities from the coast to the deep ocean, including all aspects of the marine biome, disease vectors, and pollutants;ensuring that data are managed wisely, guided by open data policies and shared in a timely manner;involving the public through citizen-engaged observations, information products, formal education programs and outreach; andevolving ocean governance to learn and share, identify priorities, increase diversity, promote partnerships and resolve conflicts.The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), a joint programme of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the International Science Council, launched its 2030 Strategy for discussion at the Conference. The Strategy focuses on delivering ocean information across operational services and on climate and ocean health. Following the conference discussions, GOOS plans to add priority actions and new ideas to support the 2030 Strategy.

"Governments reached several agreements to allow the continued functioning of the Vienna Convention or the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The November event was the first body serviced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to hold a virtual meeting that took multiple legally binding decisions. Parties reached agreements to ensure the continued operation of the Secretariat, the Multilateral Fund (MLF), and the various bodies of the Protocol.The meetings provided a signal that “if something should be done, it can be done,” according to one official. Other matters were postponed until 2021. Parties reached agreements to ensure the continued operation of the Secretariat, the Multilateral Fund (MLF), and the various bodies of the Protocol.The 12th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (Part I) and the 32nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer took place in a combined, virtual format from 23-27 November 2020.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreports that the agenda comprised urgent and essential items only, including: the replenishment of the Multilateral Fund for the triennium 2021-2023 (MLF); methyl bromide critical-use exemptions for 2021 and 2022; financial reports and budgets; and membership of the various Protocol bodies and assessment panels.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletin(ENB)summaryof the meeting notes that the 2021-2023 replenishment of the MLF, which assists developing countries in meeting their obligations under the Montreal Protocol, was “the most important agenda item” as “parties had to ensure the MLF Secretariat could continue operating in 2021.” After four days of virtual contact group discussions, delegates agreed to roll over any unspent funds from the 2018-2020 triennium and allow the rollover balance to be used as an interim budget for 2021-2023. Parties also agreed “to authorize the Secretariat to arrange for an extraordinary MOP in 2021 to take a decision on the final programme budget for 2021-2023, should circumstances allow.”The parties also reached agreements on critical-use exemptions for ozone-depleting methyl bromide for 2021-2022. During the discussion, participants were informed that: amounts nominated for critical use continue to fall; atmospheric concentrations are declining; and reporting of stocks shows there have been higher levels of production than consumption for a number of years, leading to unknown quantities of unreported stocks.Parties decided that the second part of COP 12 will be held in conjunction with MOP 33, which they agreed will take place in Nairobi, Kenya, from 25-29 October 2021. MOP 32 President Krajnik expressed hope that “the next MOP will be in-person rather than virtual.”The Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987, is considered the most successful multilateral environmental agreement.

"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched a data dashboard for the SDG indicators to help its 56 European member countries monitor their progress on the 2030 Agenda. The platform presents data from its member states for 80 “regionally relevant” SDG indicators from across all 17 Goals.The UNECE Dashboard for SDGs was launched on 13 March 2020, ahead of UNECE’s Regional Forum on Sustainable Development. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RFSD will only convene for a half-day, online meeting on 19 March 2020.Data disaggregation remains a major gap in monitoring the SDGs.The Dashboard draws on data from the UN Global SDG Database. The 80 indicators included in the dashboard are listed at theindicator menu page.The Dashboard allows users to:See “snapshots” by country, and compare countries;View differences between women and men;Create graphs and maps; andAccess definitions and explanations.Users can download full datasets for more in-depth analysis.Announcing the launch of the Dashboard, UNECE notes that a major gap in monitoring the SDGs is data disaggregation. Although the 2030 Agenda calls for examining indicators for specific population groups – broken up by sex, age, ethnicity, as well as migratory, disability and/or indigenous status – data collection still must be significantly increased to make this possible. UNECE reports that “to date, the only disaggregation offered in the UNECE dashboard is by sex, where possible with the currently-available data.”UNECE adds that it is working to improve measurement in areas of the SDGs that are particularly hard to measure, including disaggregated poverty measurement, migration statistics, environmental statistics and indicators, climate change-related statistics, and statistics on children and youth.The2020 RFSDvirtual meeting will take place on 19 March 2020, per thisupdateon changes to UNECE meetings due to COVID-19. [UNECE press release]",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"12 September 2019: Ahead of the SDG Summit, countries and other stakeholders have submitted 45 ‘SDG Acceleration Actions,’ describing voluntary initiatives to speed up implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is featuring the acceleration actions on a website. The platform indicates that the Goals on poverty eradication (SDG 1), climate action (SDG 13), and partnerships (SDG 17) are the subject of the greatest number of initiatives, while the lowest number address SDG 10 (reduced inequalities).In May 2019, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcesannouncedthe call for SDG Acceleration Actions, which will be highlighted by the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) when it meets under the UNGA’s auspices from 24-25 September 2019 (also known as the ‘SDG Summit’). The Summit takes place at the level of Heads of State and Government, and is mandated to follow up and review progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs.Finland commits to carbon neutrality by 2035, and becoming “carbon negative” soon after that.Per the call forSDG Acceleration Actions, they are expected to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Resource-based, with Time-based deliverables), and to contribute to policy coherence and reflect interlinkages among SDGs. The platform also allows users to report on the implementation of their commitment.Among the actions featured on the platform,Finland has registered a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and to become “carbon negative” soon after that;The Netherlands indicates that it will double its target for the number of people who obtain access to justice in 2020, and that half of them will be women;Project Everyone’s World’s Largest Lesson Nigeria says it aims to have “an immediate impact” of 500,000 children engaged in learning about the SDGs, 30,000 children engaged in after-school clubs and local community action projects, and 8,000 youth and teacher volunteers trained to teach the SDGs; andThe UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) announces that it will host a ‘Trees in Cities’ Challenge to plant more trees in urban areas, in cooperation with local governments.DESA intends to update the SDG Acceleration Actions webpage on a daily basis to reflect additional submitted actions.

"The 2019 Global Landscapes Forum (GLF) Investment Case Symposium explored advances in sustainable finance, asset management, industry breakthroughs in sustainable investment, and the evolving role of capital markets in a low-carbon future.The three-day event took place immediately following the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Regional Roundtable on Sustainable Finance. Approximately 500 leaders of sustainable finance institutions, politicians, researchers and practitioners, as well as an online audience, explored how to mainstream investments in sustainable land use to achieve a transformational shift towards climate-smart production models.According to data cited by UNEP at the meeting, an estimated US$800 billion is needed to restore 350 million hectares of degraded landscapes, a fraction of the roughly US$5.2 trillion that is spent annually on fossil fuel subsidies. AUNEP-hostedsession noted that finance alone is not a silver bullet, and accelerating the transition to sustainable land use may require addressing the distribution of value within value chains and establishing regulatory regimes that reward land stewardship. The discussions explored innovative financial instruments for investments in sustainable land management, especially for smallholders and other land-users who lack collateral and land tenure security.Numerous examples of blended instruments for sustainable land-use finance were shared, such as a partnership between Ugandan conservation NGO EcoTrust and USAID, aimed at helping households monetize their landholdings through sales of carbon credits on the global market. The project builds on a mechanism developed by Althelia Funds to structure carbon sequestration as collateral for communities with few other assets. In another example, banking group Crédit Agricole du Maroc, described as “a web of banks,” was highlighted as an example of how to successfully fund “unbankable” farmers who hold no collateral.While the role of consumers and bank shareholders in demanding sustainable and ethical products and businesses was highlighted, the discussions noted that “the catch-up time to transform global markets,” – namely consumer goods, energy and transportation – requires risk-taking, significant spending, policy change, close monitoring of the development processes and climate change mitigation efforts. Representatives of multinational financial institutions stressed the need to change the regulatory environment of banking “on a global scale,” and unlock public finance to leverage private investments towards such long-term goals.Held in Luxembourg from 26-28 November 2019, the event was the fourth annual edition of the GLF annual Investment Case Symposium. The event was co-organized by Luxembourg for Finance and hosted by the Government of Luxembourg.The GLF is a knowledge-led platform on integrated land use, dedicated to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement on climate change. The Forum takes a holistic approach to creating sustainable landscapes that are productive, prosperous, equitable and resilient and considers five cohesive themes of food and livelihood initiatives, landscape restoration, rights, finance and measuring progress. It is led by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) of the CGIAR Consortium, in collaboration with its co-founders UNEP and the World Bank, and nearly 30 Charter Members.

The statement recognizes efforts made in response to COVID-19 and affirms the ministers’ commitment to working together to combat the pandemic and its impacts on trade and the economy in the region.Issued on 29 May 2020, the 14-paragraph statement acknowledges that the global spread of the novel coronavirus requires synchronized responses at both regional and global levels. Thus, ASEAN and China are partnering to enhance coordination.The statement commits ASEAN and China to sharing “anti-pandemic information,” knowledge, experiences, and best practices in a prompt, efficient, and regular manner. It further commits the countries to facilitating production of and access to medicines and vaccines for COVID-19. These actions, the statement notes, serve to mitigate the negative impacts on healthcare, manufacturing, trade, investment, and tourism.On trade, the ministers reaffirm the importance of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) to boosting trade and investment and ensuring stable, inclusive growth in the region. According to ASEAN data, bilateral trade more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, growing from USD 235.5 billion in 2010 to USD 497 billion in 2019. Based on China’s statistics, its bilateral trade with ASEAN is following similar trends, expanding from USD 292.8 billion in 2010 to USD 641.5 billion in 2019. The statement notes that trade relations will be critical to maintaining confidence in the regional economy and that trade presents a significant opportunity for the region’s economic recovery from the effects of COVID-19.The ministers also recognize that implementation of the ACFTA is vital to “promoting the free flow of goods and services, enhancing two-way investment,” and maintaining supply chains’ integrity. Smooth cross-border flow of food, agricultural products, commodities, medicines and medical supplies, and essential goods and services is specifically called out in the statement. Accordingly, the statement recognizes possibilities around improved market access through,inter alia, non-tariff measures and e-commerce.The statement further underscores that “any emergency trade measures deemed necessary to tackle COVID-19 shall be targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary.” Such measures, the statement emphasizes, shall not create unnecessary barriers to trade, and “shall take into account the standards and recommendations of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and be consistent with the rights and obligations of each Party under the World Trade Organization (WTO) covered agreements.”The statement closes by reiterating the countries’ commitment to a free, open, transparent, non-discriminatory, predictable, and stable trade and investment environment. This environment, the statement highlights, will create synergies and opportunities for post-crisis revitalization, thereby contributing to the prosperity and stability of the global economy.

"The International Trade Centre (ITC) and partners launched the SME Trade Finance Guide at the SME Finance Forum. The guide aims to help small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) exporters and importers learn about and access finance for trade.The guide defines trade finance as “the financing of goods or services in a trade or transaction, from a supplier through to the end buyer.” Trade finance accounts for 3% of global trade and is worth approximately USD 3 trillion annually. Trade finance, also known as supply chain finance and import and export finance, is an umbrella term that includes a variety of financial instruments that importers and exporters can utilize.The guide titled, ‘Trade Finance Explained: An SME Guide for Importers and Exporters,’ describes the types of trade finance structures available to SME importers and exporters. These include trade credit, cash advances, purchase order finance, receivables discounting, term loans, and other types of business finance such as equity finance, leasing and asset-backed finance, and asset finance. The guide provides an overview of methods of payment, including cash advances, letters of credit, documentary collections and open accounts, and describes the suitability of each method for various business requirements. The guide highlights product, manufacturing, transport, and currency risks and challenges, and outlines how to access trade finance from different lending sources.The guide recognizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SME access to trade and export finance. Within this context, the guide outlines opportunities to help SMEs recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to new orders. Trade in some markets and sectors is picking up, with levels at or above those of the same period in 2019, it notes.Commenting on the guide’s release, ITCs Senior Adviser on Access to Financing, Ian Sayers, reflected that trade financing has been seen as the business of international buyers. Sayers said it is “time for SMEs to realize its potential to help them pivot into new markets, get new certifications, expand their workforce and make sustainability improvements.” He expressed hope that the guide will stimulate SMEs’ enthusiasm to explore locally available trade-related financing facilities.A number of organizations and institutions contributed to the guide, including ITC, Trade Finance Global, the Federation of Small Businesses, Institute of Export and International Trade, the British Exporters Association, Forum of Private Business, and The International Finance Corporation (IFC). [Publication:Trade Finance Explained: An SME Guide for Importers and Exporters] [Guide Landing Page] [ITC Press Release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The UNFCCC Secretariat published three papers that document the climate technology “journey” – the path between the identification of technological needs for countries to increase sustainability and develop climate change resilience, to full implementation of those technologies.The publications review best practices for responding to countries’ technological requirements, the significant role that innovation plays in speeding up the implementation of technology, and opportunities to leverage new technology approaches to increase coastal resilience to climate change. The Technology Executive Committee (TEC), the policy arm of the UNFCCC’s Technology Mechanism, organized a virtual event to launch the publications.Part of the TEC’s regular briefing series, thepapertitled, ‘Enhancing Implementation of the Results of Technology Needs Assessments,’ explores the starting point of countries’ climate technology journey, including the identification and prioritization of climate technologies best suited to each country’s needs.  The report reviews challenges, best practices, and opportunities for improvement in the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) process, which countries undertake to determine their climate technology priorities. It also provides case studies that demonstrate countries’ progress in implementing TNA-prioritized technologies.The publications show the crucial role of technologies in the transition to low-carbon, resilient economies.Thepapertitled, ‘Innovative Approaches to Accelerating and Scaling Up Climate Technology Implementation for Mitigation and Adaptation,’ reviews opportunities to scale up the implementation of identified climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies through innovative approaches. The paper presents innovations in the following areas: the country selection process for technology options; the solicitation process by climate technology planners of stakeholder views and practitioner knowledge and preferences; financial innovations for enhancing funding for technology projects and programmes; and opportunities for enhancing private sector engagement and incubators.Finally, thepapertitled, ‘Technologies for Averting, Minimizing and Addressing Loss and Damage in Coastal Zones,’ provides an overview of knowledge on climate change-related loss and damage in coastal zones. It also reviews the technologies for averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage. Co-issued by the TEC and the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), the policy brief highlights technologies needed for risk assessment, risk retention, and recovery and rehabilitation in coastal zones, and reviews how combinations of technologies can be used to comprehensively assess, manage, and accommodate the impacts of climate change.In welcoming the publications, TEC Chair Mareer Husny warned that the challenges posed by COVID-19 “should not be an excuse for us to delay our work to address climate change.” These publications, said Husny, “show the crucial role of technologies in the transition to low-carbon, resilient economies,” as governments prepare green economic recovery packages to address the COVID-19 crisis. [UNFCCC Press Release] [Publication:Enhancing Implementation of the Results of Technology Needs Assessments] [Publication:Innovative Approaches to Accelerating and Scaling Up Climate Technology Implementation for Mitigation and Adaptation] [Publication:Technologies for Averting, Minimizing and Addressing Loss and Damage in Coastal Zones]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"UN leaders marking the International Day for Biological Diversity challenged the international community to promote ecosystem-based solutions that address biodiversity loss, climate change, and land degradation simultaneously, and to mainstream biodiversity in economic sectors.In its first-ever online-only campaign, this International Day has focused on the theme, ‘Our Solutions Are in Nature.’The lead up to the Day, which is celebrated annually on 22 May, focused on science and traditional knowledge as a way to understand the drivers of biodiversity loss and pathways for a sustainable future, and linkages among biodiversity, climate, and land.In 2020, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were set to be achieved, and negotiations on a 2050 vision for biodiversity are underway.The year 2020 is significant for international biodiversity policy for a number of reasons. The objectives in the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan on Biodiversity and its 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets were set to be achieved by the close of the year. In addition, the 2011-2020 UN Decade on Biodiversity is coming to a close. Reflections on these experiences are feeding into planning for the “post-2020” global biodiversity framework, which will provide a 2050 vision for biodiversity. The negotiation of a new framework is underway. Leaders from around the world are expected to focus on this framework at the UN Biodiversity Summit, in September. The new framework is scheduled to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15). While the COVID-19 pandemic has postponed some of these preparations and pushed them into 2021, the celebration of International Day for Biological Diversity aims to prompt reflection on the importance of working together at all levels to build a future of life in harmony with nature.In a video message marking the Day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres highlighted that “COVID-19 – which emanated from the wild – has shown how human health is intimately connected with our relationship to the natural world.” He emphasized the need to work together to preserve biodiversity in order to achieve the SDGs as we “seek to build back better from the current crisis.”Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Acting Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),stressedthat biodiversity remains the answer to sustainable development challenges and basis for a sustainable future. She highlighted the need to build a resilient and sustainable global economy that incorporates nature and equitable sharing of its benefits. [CBD webpage for IDB 2020] [Message of UN Secretary-General] [CBD message][Messages marking IDB 2020]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1
"The first Finance in Common Summit gathered the world’s 450 public development banks to address recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in line with the principles of sustainable finance. In a joint declaration the Banks pledge to align financing decisions with the Paris Agreement on climate change.The Summit took place virtually from 9-12 November 2020. It was organized by the Government of France in support of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will be marked in December 2020. It was also envisioned as a key milestone ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26), the UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), and theGeneration Equality Forum.The organizers noted that public development banks provide the funding for large infrastructure projects in the energy sector, among others, and are key for redirecting finance from projects that rely on fossil fuels to lower-carbon projects. Public development banks make 10% of all global investments from public and private sources.The banks issued ajoint declarationpledging to increase their focus on the climate emergency. The signatories “commit to align our activities with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and to support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to reach zero net emissions as early as possible. The Banks also “will mainstream resilience and adaptation in our strategies and operations and enhance action to fund the definition and implementation of national adaptation plans. We will help redirect private financial flows in support of low-carbon and climate-resilient sustainable development.”Pledges also address: the energy transition; biodiversity, oceans, and nature; health; gender equality; digitalization; and leaving no one behind. The declaration highlights the need for a “global framework for SDG-compatible finance.” Further on SDG financing, it supports the convergence of practices towards “core standards” set out in the 2018 report of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance. The declaration cites instruments to shift more investment to sustainable assets, such as by using a shadow price of carbon and providing information on SDG reporting.The declaration ends with a section on “the road ahead,” which notes that the second Finance in Common meeting will be convened in 2021 to take stock of the first initiatives and set up a method for monitoring progress on the declaration.Marcos Neto, UN Development Programme (UNDP),said thatbuilding on the pledge, the governments that fund each public development bank must ensure their mandates tie lending practices to lower emissions.Before the Summit, a group of European development banks issued a separate pledge to phase out fossil fuel investments, and said they will work towards a stronger position on investment in coal in time for COP 26. [Finance in Common Summit webpage] [Press release]",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
"Transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to account for 5.3% of all anthropogenic emissions by 2030, up from 5% in 2016, according to a report published by the International Transport Forum (ITF) and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Therefore, UNWTO calls for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to transform tourism for climate action.The report titled, ‘Transport-related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector: Modelling Results,’ also notes that while the number of tourists is increasing, the sector is progressing towards low-carbon travel, and emissions per passenger kilometer are expected to decrease over the next decade.The report provides insights into the evolution of tourism demand across the different global regions up to 2030, and details emissions produced by different modes of tourism transport. With growing international and domestic tourism, the data are presented alongside the expected transport-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the tourism sector against the current ambition scenario for the decarbonization of transport.During the report’s launch, UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler urged tourism policymakers to use the data effectively and ensure that the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate crisis. Ovais Sarmad, UNFCCC Deputy Executive Secretary, said that while many Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) cite tourism as a concern, industry must do more, and governments must align their policies, so that at the international level, we can collectively work to increase ambition. He cited theOne Planet Sustainable Tourism Programmeas a critical mechanism to promote sustainable tourism.The report also finds that that: transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to increase by 25% from 2016 to 2030; tourism-related transport emissions will be approximately 21% of all transport emissions in 2030; and international and domestic arrivals are expected to increase from 20 billion in 2016 to 37 billion in 2030, which, in addition to an increase in emissions, will lead to socioeconomic development and job creation.The report also recommends that the tourism sector determine its own high-ambition scenario to complement the efforts of the transport sector. For example, tourism could advance towards decoupling growth from emissions.The report was launched during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain.

"18 June 2019: The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC) has released a report on energy efficiency in G20 economies that presents an update on the G20 Energy Efficiency Leading Programme (EELP) and an overview of technical work undertaken during the year.The report titled, ‘Accelerating Energy Efficiency Progress in G20 Economies,’ was presented during the G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth, which convened from 15-16 June 2019, in Karuizawa, Japan.G20 countries are working together to progress energy transitions that achieve ‘3E+S’: energy security, economic efficiency, and environmental safety. In this context, energy efficiency is critical to the G20’s efforts to facilitate such transitions, including by securing a more sustainable, cost-effective energy future.The report captures progress made on the implementation of the G20 EELP and its initiatives and outlines opportunities for G20 voluntary actions aimed at raising awareness on the importance of innovation, that is “accelerating the virtuous circle of environmental protection and economic growth by innovation.”TheEELPwas launched in 2016 as a platform for energy efficiency and international cooperation, with a focus on buildings, industry, transport, appliances, and cross-sectoral areas such as finance. It is the G20’s first long-term plan for energy efficiency up to 2030, and its implementation helps support and advance the design, acceleration and enactment of national energy efficiency policies and programmes. This led to the endorsement by most G20 members of the 2017 G20 Action Plan on Climate and Energy for Growth, which includes theG20 Energy Efficiency Investment Toolkit.The report details that, over the past five years, G20 EELP initiatives (or Task Groups), coordinated by IPEEC, have focused on: super-efficient equipment and appliances deployment; networked devices; buildings; transport; energy management; finance; energy efficiency best available technologies and best practices; ‘high-efficiency, low-emissions,’ energy end use data and energy efficiency metrics; district energy systems; and theEnergy Efficiency Knowledge Sharing Framework.The report concludes that the G20 EELP Task Groups continue to play a central role in accelerating energy efficiency policies and programmes in G20 economies, by: deepening technical collaboration among G20 economies on implementation of best practices; providing technical assistance for developing policy frameworks and roadmaps; and facilitating ongoing dialogue between governments, industry and other key stakeholders.The report emphasizes the importance of cooperative efforts to reduce energy demand to achieve energy transitions that support ‘3E+S’. It also calls for,inter alia: gathering reliable energy efficiency data; and raising awareness regarding the role of finance and investment in promoting innovation in clean technology and energy efficiency.The report encourages G20 members to advance innovation to implement the economy-wide decarbonization strategies that are needed to deliver optimal net zero pathways and societal benefits of the energy transition, as well as climate objectives and the SDGs.Established in 2009, IPEEC identifies and facilitates implementation of public policies and programmes related to energy efficiency.

"30 September 2019: The UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) Group of Experts on Coal Mine Methane released guidance on best practices for methane recovery from abandoned coal mines. The guide recommends promoting maximum extraction and use or destruction of emissions from methane in closed or abandoned mines.According to UNECE, methane is a “short-lived climate pollutant” (SLCP) that is the main precursor of tropospheric ozone (O3). Methane’s effect on global warming is “84 times greater than carbon dioxide” (CO2) over a 20-year period due to its 12-year atmospheric life. Fossil fuel production, including coal mining, is one of the main sources of methane. In 2016, for instance, US coal mines released an amount of methane equivalent to the warming impact caused by 13 million cars. Mines continue to emit methane even after they are closed, resulting in “Abandoned Mine Methane” (AMM). AMM emissions are expected to increase from 17% of total mine methane emissions in 2010 to 24% in 2050.There are increasing opportunities to address environmental impacts by monitoring and mitigating methane emissions from abandoned mines.Within this context, UNECE’s guidance titled, ‘Best Practice Guidance for Effective Methane Recovery and Use from Abandoned Coal Mines,’ aims to raise awareness of AMM opportunities and hazards. The guide highlights the benefits of AMM capture and use, including improved energy supply, environmental performance, safety and air quality. For example, AMM extraction and use projects provide energy from a resource that would otherwise be wasted and contribute emissions to the atmosphere. AMM can therefore help to meet SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action). The guide features case studies from Germany, Poland, the UK and the US that share how these countries have utilized the potential of AMM.UNECE presented the Guidance at the 28th session of the Committee on Sustainable Energy, which took place in Geneva, Switzerland, from 25-27 September 2019. UNECE’s Sustainable Energy Division Director, Scott Foster, said the world cannot “walk away” from its coal mining legacy, and emphasized that there are “increasing opportunities to address environmental impacts by monitoring and mitigating methane emissions from abandoned mines.”The Guidance complements the UNECE’s 2010 ‘Best Practice Guidance on Effective Methane Drainage and Use in Coal Mines.’ [Publication:Best Practice Guidance for Effective Methane Recovery and Use from Abandoned Coal Mines] [UNECE Press Release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Speakers during the high-level segment of the 31st Meeting of the Parties (MOP 31) to the Montreal Protocol highlighted the interconnectedness of environmental challenges, punctuating a theme that was addressed in many respects during the week-long meeting.MOP 31 was the first such meeting following the entry into force of the Kigali Amendment. This Amendment was agreed at MOP 28, in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2016. It amends the Protocol to set phase-down schedules for hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are produced as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and thus a result of ozone depleting substances (ODS) phase-out efforts. HFCs are not a threat to the ozone layer, but have a high global warming potential (GWP).TheEarth Negotiations Bulletin(ENB) analysis from MOP 31 highlights that “parties acknowledged the Kigali Amendment is the bridge between the ozone and climate regimes.” In addition, the Amendment connects to issues of food security and sustainable agriculture, as well as to access to energy efficient technology.These interconnections were discussed at MOP 31, which convened from 4-8 November 2019, in Rome, Italy, in relation to decisions on the terms of reference (ToR) for the study on the 2021-2023 replenishment of the Multilateral Fund (MLF), the unexpected emissions of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), and the areas of focus for the 2022 quadrennial assessment reports of the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP), the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) and the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP). MOP 31 also addressed: review of the TEAP’s ToR, composition, balance, fields of expertise, and workload; ongoing reported emissions of carbon tetrachloride (CTC); critical use exemptions (CUEs); and issues of non-compliance.On unexpected CFC-11 emissions, the meeting concluded with a decision that provides for information gathering on illegal activities and illegal trade of banned substances and encourages intersessional discussion. The ENB analysis notes that, “many noted this will serve as a ‘litmus test’ of the Protocol’s ability to effectively address and resolve compliance matters.”The topics for the quadrennial assessment reports of the three Assessment Panels will include the state of the ozone layer, the interactions between ozone and climate, the effects of changes in the ozone layer on human health and ecosystems, as well as alternative technologies to the controlled substances. These reports will be submitted by the end of 2022 for consideration by Parties.In addition, Parties were invited to sign the Rome Declaration on the Contribution of the Montreal Protocol to Food Loss Reduction through Sustainable Cold Chain Management. The Declaration will remain open for signature up until the start of MOP 32 in November 2020. It highlights cold chain’s key role in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs. [Earth Negotiations Bulletin Coverage of MOP 31] [UNEP Press Release]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1
"28 August 2019: Civil society representatives and UN officials discussed solutions to sustainability challenges posed by urban life, at the 68th session of the UN Civil Society Conference. The Conference focused on the theme, ‘Building Inclusive and Sustainable Cities and Communities.’The UN Civil Society Conference convened from 28-28 August 2019, in Salt Lake City, Utah, US. It was organized by the UN Department of Global Communications (DGC), the NGO Executive Committee and Salt Lake City, which was selected for its track record of inclusion and sustainability, including taking climate action. Youth participants contributed by the planning by holding co-chair roles on most sub-committees for the Conference, and by developing a thematic session on youth employment and opportunity.In avideo messageto the Conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “well-planned and managed cities can steer us towards inclusive growth” and serve as models of harmony among diverse people. He highlighted the role of cities in addressing global challenges, including climate change, saying they can support a path towards low-emission development.Alison Smale, DGC head, emphasized that making cities inclusive, sustainable, resilient and safe is critical to achieving the SDGs by 2030. Maruxa Cardama, Secretary General of the Partnership for Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT), described cities as “living laboratories” where the challenges and opportunities that are central to the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change become tangible.The Conference adopted anOutcome Documentthat presents a global vision for achieving inclusive and sustainable cities by 2030, and stresses the “urgent need for climate action.” The Outcome Document notes that cities and communities are central to the achievement of “all SDGs and not only SDG 11.” It highlights the importance of inclusivity, peace, family, education, youth, and empowerment of women and girls.The Outcome Document calls for addressing the specific conditions of mountainous areas and small island developing States (SIDS), and the interdependence of rural and urban prosperity. It also cites the need for collaboration and partnership to create humane cities in which “people can flourish and enhance the quality of life and dignity for all.” UN General Assembly (UNGA) President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés welcomed the Outcome Document at the closing plenary session, telling participants, “you can count on me to be your advocate.”Taking place ahead of the September 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, the Conference also yielded a stand-aloneclimate compactdrafted and adopted by youth participants. The compact identifies specific actions to reduce the impacts of climate change and adapt mindsets and structures. The text urges everyone to “incite climate action in their own communities” to grow a network of motivated and concerned youth.By the compact, youth participants make a range of pledges, such as educating themselves and their networks on the impact of individuals on climate change through daily lifestyle choices, avoiding single-use plastic products and packaging, reducing waste, protecting forests and rainforests, using renewable sources of energy, and divesting from fossil fuels and mining.

"18 July 2019: During an event on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), Alamine Ousmane Mey, Minister of Economy, Planning and Regional Development, Cameroon, presented the country’s first Voluntary National Review (VNR).The event, organized by the Government of Cameroon, took place on 18 July 2019. Mey explained that the methodology adopted for Cameroon’s VNR was based on normative, participatory and inclusive approaches.For the coming years, Cameroon has prioritized: intensification of national ownership of the SDGs; establishment of a national multi-stakeholder monitoring framework to act as a review and accountability platform for SDG implementation; and elaboration of strategies to increase partnerships and mobilize financial resources for SDG implementation.Mey said that the VNR focuses on, among others, the SDGs that HLPF 2019 reviewed.For example, on SDGs 4 (quality education), he cited an increase in student enrollment and progress regarding access, expansion and reduction of disparities in education. He said student completion rates during the first cycle of the secondary level improved from 53.2% in 2015 to 80% in 2018. However, emphasizing a focus on primary education in particular, he acknowledged deteriorating primary level completion rates and pupil-teacher ratio, and that security tensions disrupt education efforts.On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Mey cited average economic growth of 4% per year, and said the government is working to achieve the 7% economic growth rate required to meet the SDGs.He said achieving SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) remains a challenge for Cameroon, and mentioned efforts to enhance social safety nets and policies that increase the number of beneficiaries and progressively increase minimum wages.For SDG 13 (climate action), May underscored the creation of an inter-ministerial committee to follow-up on implementation of the Paris Agreement, and drew attention to the challenge of mobilizing resources to implement National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and to finance alternative activities to deforestation.On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), he stressed the need to reinforce trust and confidence in national institutions for greater efficiency, inclusion and justice.On challenges related to SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mey emphasized ensuring large-scale mobilization of multiple stakeholders, promoting a fair and inclusive digital economy and improving economic competitiveness.Mey also supported,inter alia, strengthening statistics for better monitoring; transferring competences to local authorities; and scaling up finance management to promote local resilience and poverty reduction.A video presentation showcased actions in Cameroon on promoting decent jobs, climate action, peace to achieve social reconciliation, and disarmament. During the discussion, a representative from Cameroon underlined the importance of intensifying national ownership to accelerate the integration of SDGs into.IISD Reporting Services coveredselected side eventsduring HLPF 2019.

"5 July 2019: The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) launched a guide for water resource managers and planners, which outlines a management framework for treating coastal and inland water-related ecosystems as an undivided whole. The guide highlights the benefits of source-to-sea management in linking implementation of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) with SDG 14 (life below water) to address issues such as land-based sources of marine pollution, fragmentation of wildlife habitat, and overall degradation of freshwater, terrestrial and marine environments.While not specifically mentioned in the SDGs, the need for a source-to-sea approach is referred to in several UN agency programme documents, funding strategies of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), as well as the outcome document from the 2018 Dushanbe High-Level Conference on SDG 6.The SIWI publication titled, ‘Implementing the Source-to-Sea Approach: A Guide for Practitioners,’ presents the case for source-to-sea management, stating that such an approach can help balance upstream and downstream demands and ensure that the socioeconomic and environmental dimensions of development are considered in an integrated manner. Such an approach is needed, it is argued, to adequately manage issues such as: plastic waste entering the ocean from rivers and waterways; nutrient loads in run-off from agricultural activities, causing eutrophication (excessive presence of nutrients) and “dead zones” in coastal and marine waters; the discharge of inadequately treated wastewater; and the impact of dams and other infrastructure on fish migration and, consequently, food security of populations that depend on the fishery.The 64-page guide outlines six steps in implementing a source-to-sea approach: 1) selecting priority flows and determining the system boundary; 2) mapping stakeholders and preparing a plan to engage with them; 3) analyzing the governance system and practices related to the priority flows; 4) developing a theory of change and identifying appropriate interventions; 5) funding and implementing source-to-sea actions; and 6) monitoring, disseminating lessons learned, and undertaking adaptive management.SIWI is calling for source-to-sea linkages to be recognized and addressed as an essential part of action to achieve the SDGs. The organization hosts theAction Platform for Source-to-Sea Management(the S2S Platform), a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to contribute to global knowledge and promote collaboration to improve the management of land, water, coastal, and marine linkages. The source-to-sea approach was first developed by the S2S Platform and the GEF.

"The co-facilitators for an intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) are preparing for the second round of discussions. Ahead of the virtual exchange on 5 February 2021, they are asking UN Member States to address specific several questions, building on the first informal consultations that took place on 25 January 2021.In a letter to UN Member States on 28 January 2021, Alexander Marschik, Permanent Representative of Austria, and Cheikh Niang, Permanent Representative of Senegal, provide guiding questions relating to strengthening the HLPF as well as the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The two reviews are being conducted jointly following mandates in UNGA resolutions 67/290, 70/299, 72/305, and 74/298.Governments will discuss potential themes and SDGs for in-depth review during the HLPF sessions in 2022 and 2023.For the review of HLPF, guiding questions address potential themes and SDGs for in-depth review during the HLPF sessions in 2022 and 2023, as these have not yet been agreed. Other guiding questions cover the broader issue of strengthening various features of the Forum (e.g. Voluntary National Reviews, linkages with regional forums, and the sessions held at summit level under UNGA auspices every four years). Another guiding question asks how the HLPF review can account for the SDG targets that had a 2020 deadline.For the ECOSOC review, the co-facilitators seek Member States’ views on changes that could better equip the Council to oversee the UN development system’s operational activities, and channel the contributions of various bodies towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Other guiding questions relate to: the ECOSOC calendar and sequencing of segments and events; ways for ECOSOC help countries recover from COVID-19 and get back on track for the SDGs; making ECOSOC more understandable to “outsiders”; and strengthening the contribution of major groups and other stakeholders and enhancing the participation of civil society, the private sector, local governments, and scientists.Following the virtual consultation on 5 February, the co-facilitators will prepare a zero draft of a resolution for discussion on 19 February. Additional consultations are scheduled for 26 February, 11 March, 19 March, and 31 March. The co-facilitators aim to finalize negotiations by the end of March to avoid competing with other processes.The co-facilitators note that they are committed to a “completely open, transparency and inclusive” process.

"The World Food Programme (WFP) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) have published a report, in which they review the current evidence base regarding the impact of anticipatory action, and determine that more robust empirical data and a strong monitoring, evaluation, and learning agenda are needed to scale up the approach and ensure that it achieves intended results.Titled, ‘The Evidence Base on Anticipatory Action,’ the report defines anticipatory action as a humanitarian disaster risk reduction (DRR) and preparedness practice by which support is delivered to vulnerable communities ahead of a forecast severe weather event or other shock. Programmes using the practice are increasing in quantity and scope, according to the report, and 30 partners committed to significantly increasing anticipatory action coverage at the September 2019Climate Action Summit.The report reviews existing evidence produced by anticipatory action partners, and concludes that while impacts are mainly positive, the evidence is often fragmented, incomplete in scope, and in need of methodological improvements. The report recommends that anticipatory action programme partners increase investments in monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems and develop a common analytical framework for anticipatory action programme assessment utilizing improved evaluation models.The report finds that primary data on anticipatory action programme results are limited. It recommends that additional resources be devoted to establishing robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems to ensure that evidence of programme impact be produced at a high standard and can be used to improve the future design and delivery of anticipatory action.Implementing agencies must agree on a common analytical framework to use in administering and assessing anticipatory action, according to the report. This will ensure coherence and methodological rigor of the future evidence base, and will be necessary in order to conduct cross-country, cross-hazard, and cross project comparisons.The publication also emphasizes the importance of designing models which accurately and more transparently estimate the value of avoided losses. It recommends that evaluation methodologies extend beyond the calculations currently utilized, which employ return on investment and cost-benefit analysis, to also capture and emphasize the public goods and collective benefits associated with anticipatory action.The report applauds current efforts by anticipatory action partners to improve monitoring, evaluation, and learning, including work towards developing best practice manuals and guidelines on monitoring and evaluation, as well as the establishment of a group to create a common analytical framework.

"The flagship publication of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) reports progress on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health.The CBD Secretariatlaunchedthefifth Global Biodiversity Outlook(GBO-5) on 15 September 2020, during the first of four days of ‘Special Virtual Sessions’ taking place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition to the eight transition areas, GBO-5 reviews progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 10) in October 2010, and were set for the 2011-2020 period. GBO-5 draws on indicators, research studies, and assessments, including the IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as national reports submitted to the CBD.Conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions, among other areas of progress reported in GBO-5.The report highlights ten areas in which progress can be viewed:almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems;the rate of deforestation has fallen globally by about one-third compared to the previous decade;where good fisheries management policies have been introduced, the abundance of marine fish stocks has been maintained or rebuilt;an increasing number of successful cases of eradication of invasive alien species from islands has been reported;a significant expansion of protected area has been reported;conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions;the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization has come into force and is fully operational in at least 87 countries and internationally;national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) have been updated in line with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 by 170 countries (85% of CBD Parties);there has been an increase in the available data and information on biodiversity; andfinancial resources available for biodiversity through international flows have doubled.The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” that draws on efforts related to: enhanced conservation and restoration of ecosystems; climate change mitigation; action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation; more sustainable production of goods and services; and reduced consumption and waste.Also highlighted during the launch event was the second edition of theLocal Biodiversity Outlooks(LBO-2). LBO-2 focuses on local biodiversity and stories of resilience among indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs). It proposes six transition areas aligned with GBO-5:Cultural transitions towards diverse ways of knowing and being;Land transitions towards securing customary land tenure of IPLCs;Governance transitions towards inclusive decision-making and self-determined development;Incentives and financial transitions towards rewarding effective culturebased solutions;Economic transitions towards sustainable use and diverse local economies; andFood transitions towards revitalising indigenous and local food systems.Joji Carino, Forest Peoples Programme, launched the report as part of the 15 September event. According to theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, Carino said IPLCs are underrepresented in national strategies and action plans, “despite agreement that putting culture and the rights of IPLCs at the heart of biodiversity strategy can bring about positive outcomes.”The event also launched a review of progress towards theGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020.

"10 September 2019: A study of health equity in 53 European countries has identified a gap that is stationary or widening. The World Health Organization (WHO) authors are calling for policy action beyond the health sector to address the factors accounting for the lack of equity in health, which include: income insecurity, poor living conditions, social isolation, lack of access to good quality service, and employment insecurity.WHOlaunched‘Healthy, prosperous lives for all: the European Health Equity Status Report’ prior to the UN High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage, which convened in New York, US, on 23 September 2019. Zsuzanna Jakaba, Regional Director of WHO Europe, stated that governments’ efforts to address health inequity will help achieve SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), which, she noted, is the only SDG not showing upward trajectory in the region.Action to promote health equity can be effective within a short time, even within the space of an electoral term.TheWHO reportprovides country-specific as well as regional data, and uses innovative methodology to reveals the contribution of specific social factors to health outcomes, which is illustrated in numerous charts. The analysis shows how economic and social policies in non-health sectors interact with and influence health inequity.Among the main findings of the report are that people in the most disadvantaged groups have lower life expectancy than average, by up to 15 years in the case of men, and seven years in the case of women, while life expectancy for the overall population has increased. Low socioeconomic status and education levels are also linked with a higher incidence of debilitating illnesses and poor health in general. Income insecurity and poor living conditions account for 35% and 29% percent of inequitable outcomes.The report shows that inequities in mental health are just as prevalent as inequities in physical health, and that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affect the more disadvantaged groups. For example, women with the fewest years of education are almost twice as likely to have diabetes as women with the most years of education.WHO argues that action to promote health equity can be effective in a short time, even within the space of an electoral term. Such action would include: increasing government spending on housing and community amenities; increasing government spending on labor market policies; reducing income inequality; increasing expenditure on social protection; reducing unemployment; and reducing out-of-pocket payments for health services.

"22 July 2019: WWF and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) have launched a research report that argues that solar and wind power and energy storage technologies can meet the world’s energy needs while preserving the health and connectivity of river systems. The report highlights the scope for renewables to serve developing countries while avoiding construction of hydropower dams on some of the world’s major rivers, such as the Amazon, Mekong, and Irrawaddy rivers.Announcing the report, WWF highlighted a global study published in the science journalNature. The studyshowed that, of rivers measuring more than 1,000 kilometers in length, just 37% remain free-flowing. TNC drew attention to the recommendation of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to protect and restore river connectivity in the interests of maintaining freshwater fisheries and the well-being of local riparian communities. Noting that dams and reservoirs are the major cause of river habitat fragmentation, WWF highlighted that the falling costs of renewable energy can make electricity systems affordable for populations that previously lacked such access.The 104-page report titled, ‘Connected and Flowing: A Renewable Future for Rivers, Climate and People,’ finds that more than 3,700 hydropower dams are currently being planned, including large ones in Cambodia, Tanzania, and Brazil. The authors argue that, in comparison, wind and solar energy technologies are low-cost and low-impact, as well as being low-carbon, and could meet global renewable energy targets many times over. The report contains examples of countries that have successfully navigated a transition to ecologically-friendly alternatives, such as the use of “small hydro” in Switzerland, strategic dam removal in Maine, US, and uptake of solar and wind energy in Chile.The authors recommend that governments reassess their plans for hydropower to factor in the full value of rivers, and create competitive frameworks to accelerate the renewable energy revolution and help meet the international commitments of the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). They call on developers and financial institutions to facilitate the transition to renewables by supporting more comprehensive upstream planning and improving their own project assessments by using sustainability protocols and safeguards.SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, while target 7.2 seeks to increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. The report was launched ahead of the seventh World Hydropower Congress in Paris, France, from 14-16 May 2019.

"Participants at a side event held during the the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, discussed Africa’s development in light of potential asset stranding, and the need for African governments to implement effective natural resource planning to achieve low-carbon economies.The event titled, ‘Africa’s Development in the Age of Stranded Assets: Managing Risks and Seizing Opportunities,’ defined such assets as “those that have become devalued or that countries are unable to monetize due to policy changes, disruptive innovation and/or social and environmental conditions.”Facilitator Youba Sokona, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Vice-Chair, explained that the IPCCSpecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C(SR15) indicates that limiting warming has co-benefits for achieving the SDGs and, noting that socioeconomic development and environmental concerns are “at odds” in Africa, stressed the need for political will to reduce emissions.Africa must address the level of exposure to carbon market risk, burden sharing and knowledge management to ensure more efficient and effective resource use.Fatima Denton, Director, UN University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (UNU-INRA), introduced the discussion paper on ‘Africa’s Development in the Age of Stranded Assets,’ which highlights associated risks of stranding and impacts on mineral-rich countries in Africa, as well as opportunities related to green transitions and economic diversification. She said Africa must address the level of exposure to carbon market risk, burden sharing and knowledge management to ensure more efficient and effective resource use.Jame Murombedzi, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), emphasized that the relationship between production and exploitation of Africa’s resources is historically linked to external interests, including debt, and that Africa’s ability to disinvest in carbon is related to its ability to pay off its debt.Selam Kidane Abebe, Legal Advisor, African Group of Negotiators, highlighted risks in the region, including: legal risks due to commitments to treaties; social risks attributed to job losses that would result from decarbonization; and economic risks due to carbon-related foreign direct investment in Africa.Other issues considered by panelists and participants include:stranded assets representing a double burden on countries through revenue losses and decreased economic growth;the need to direct benefits of resource exploitation to local communities;positive unintended consequences of stranded assets, including a decrease in illicit financial flows;legal, economic and social implications of an energy transition, given countries’ contractual obligations to private fossil fuel companies; andfuture fossil fuel discoveries and risks associated with extraction in a 2°C world.The event, which took place on 3 December, was organized by UNU-INRA.

"ICAO has launched a Central Registry for the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The secure application will allow States to fulfill their reporting requirements under the Scheme.Adoptedby the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016, CORSIA is a market-based mechanism designed to contribute to two global aspirational goals for the international aviation sector: to increase aviation fuel efficiency 2% per year through 2050; and to achieve carbon-neutral growth in the international civil aviation industry after 2020. Under the Scheme, airlines are obligated to cap emissions growth beyond 2020 by buying carbon offsets.The CORSIA Central Registry is a secure cloud-hosted application supported by a database, where information and data related to airplane operators, verification bodies, international aviation carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, CORSIA-eligible fuels claimed, and cancelled emissions units will be stored. Following approval by the ICAO Council, ICAO will publish documents submitted through the Registry on itsCORSIA website.The launch of the application was mandated by ICAO Assembly ResolutionA40-19, whichrequestedthe ICAO Council to establish and maintain the CORSIA Central Registry by early 2020 and to continue to develop and update the CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria. In March 2020, the ICAO Councilfinalized and announcedthe six approved carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase based on the eight CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria (EUCs). The Central Registry and EUCs are two of thefive CORSIA implementation elements.Activities related to international aviation generate 1.3% of global anthropogenic carbon emissions. Eighty-five States, representing 76.76% of international aviation activities, have committed to the voluntary phase of CORSIA, which lasts from 2021-2026. The second phase (2027-2035) will be mandatory for all States, with exemptions only for least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and States with minimal international aviation activity.

"The co-facilitators for the UN’s 75th anniversary provided a briefing to stakeholders on the political declaration and other steps towards the high-level commemoration in September 2020. Stakeholders highlighted civil society priorities for the declaration as well as plans for the UN75 People’s Forum in April 2020.The briefing for stakeholders on 28 February 2020 was hosted by the NGO Committee on Sustainable Development-New York in collaboration with the UN2020 initiative and Together First.The co-facilitators, Alya Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna-Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of Sweden, held the first informal consultation meeting with UN Member States at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 21 February 2020, as reported inthis SDG Knowledge Hub story. On Member States’ priorities for the declaration, the co-facilitators reported that:Governments support a declaration that is both short and unifying, as well as substantive;The discussion indicated much convergence on key issues to address in the text, with climate change and biodiversity high on the agenda;Delegations issued calls for reforms not only of the UN Security Council but also the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); andThe importance of partnerships and the role of the private sector were emphasized during the consultation.The co-facilitators also said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hopes the declaration will call for continued dialogue after the anniversary event – to be led by Member States, the Secretary-General, or an independent commission. The co-facilitators urged NGOs to reach out to Member States and groupings to ensure the adoption of a strong political declaration.As next steps in drafting the declaration, the co-facilitators said they will present an elements paper for discussion at a consultation in early April. A zero draft will be released in May.Providing input to the co-facilitators, stakeholders said important issues include climate change, species loss, shrinking space for civil society, and peace and disarmament. They noted that corruption is an important part of Agenda 2030 that integrates the three pillars of the UN. They suggested that the UN75 declaration and the outcome text of high-level meetings on Beijing+25 (taking place inMarchandSeptember 2020) should support and reinforce each other. Participants urged the co-facilitators to find ways to include the perspectives of people who are not able to travel to the UN, and said civil society participation must be meaningful, not “ceremonial.”Alongside the political declaration, a civil society declaration is also being developed. The UN2020 network has called for inputs, and the zero draft is available for commentary until 15 March. The declaration is expected to be adopted during theUN75 People’s Forumconvening in New York, US, from 23-24 April 2020.The People’s Forum, being coordinated by UN2020 and Together First, will focus on the theme of advancing people-centered multilateralism. In addition to the People’s Declaration, it is also expected to result in a People’s Plan for Global Action.In the meantime, a UNGA youth plenary will take place on 31 March 2020 as part of UN75 consultations.

"15 August 2019: The Global Water Partnership-Caribbean (GWP-Caribbean) and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) have issued a handbook that provides guidance on monitoring progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) in the Caribbean region. The production of the handbook is part of the GWP’s broader project of improving SDG 6 monitoring, which includes workshops and training events.The handbook introduces regionally-relevant approaches, such as specifying a narrow range of chemical parameters for water testing, proposing a limited number of watersheds to be monitored, and taking into account likely budgetary constraints faced by government agencies. The publication also highlights challenges encountered in monitoring, including the lack of human resources and sufficient finances, outdated data on record, and limited comparability of data. It notes that not all data providers are familiar with SDG 6.Titled ‘SDG 6 Monitoring Guide for Caribbean SIDS,’ the publication contains observations and lessons learned during a pilot phase, during which Jamaica participated in the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6. A further national training workshop took place in Jamaica from 8-11 July 2019, in which participants agreed to adopt the standards of the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) and designed a template to monitor data from various water bodies.The GWP expressed hope that the guide will increase understanding of SDG 6, encourage tailoring of monitoring methodologies to suit Caribbean small island developing States (SIDS), and provide guidance on the application of SDG 6 indicators.

"During a virtual side event, held on the sidelines of the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), participants discussed the role of forests and forestry in accelerating transformative pathways to sustainable development. They also described approaches to transformative change for the forests-food-energy-climate nexus and their potential and limitations, emphasizing equity, gender, and governance.The event illustrated the potential for synergies among SDGs that focus on sustainable land and resource use. It emphasized policy and regulatory environments and capacities that support and incentivize sustainable forest-related livelihoods and development.The event was organized by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, and Natural Resources Institute Finland. It sought to build on work undertaken byIUFRO’s Special Project on World Forests, Society and Environment (WFSE), and the recent publicationSustainable Development Goals: Their Impacts on Forests and People.Speakers highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the appreciation for forests and  the recognition of the need to preserve natural habitats. Forest-based transformation pathways were discussed as a means to restore sustainable land use systems, freshwater use, ecosystem functions such as climate mitigation, and biodiversity restoration. Forests were also highlighted for their contributions to: preventing zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 by ensuring the balance between pathogens and host species is restored; recognizing the contribution of indigenous peoples and local communities; forest conversion moratoria; and agroforestry.Panelists also emphasized:COVID-19 has exposed gender inequalities in several areas including jobs, and caused a spike in gender violence;the importance of gender equality for sustainability and for enabling the forest sector to contribute to the SDGs; andpathways to build and strengthen synergies among SDGs related to sustainable production, reduced use of traditional wood fuels, and improved resource efficiency.The event took place on 9 July 2020 in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [ENB Coverage of the Side Event]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

"25 September 2019: The Global Water Partnership (GWP) has released 10 success stories from its Water, Climate and Development Programme (WACDEP). The programme, which launched in 2011, equips countries, partner organizations and local communities to address the impacts of climate change on water availability and water quality.The 10 stories demonstrate positive outcomes from WACDEP for small-scale agriculture (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), and water and sanitation access (SDG 6), among many other benefits.WACDEPwas designed in response to a request from the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) for GWP to support the African Union (AU) agenda on water and sanitation. The program sought to integrate water and climate adaptation into development planning and investments. WACDEP worked in cooperation with the GWP’s Integrated Drought Management Program (IDMP), which was implemented jointly with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).Overall, the programme has facilitated the incorporation of water and climate considerations into 20 formally approved national, regional, and river basin plans and strategies, influenced more than 15 investment plans with support for infrastructure financing of more than 1 billion Euro, and conducted more than 30 demonstration projects. The program also mobilized more than 25 million Euro for water and climate resilience projects.The report titled, ’10 Stories of Impact’, draws attention to the effects of climate change as experienced through floods, droughts, rainfall, and variability in the water cycle. The stories cover a wide variety of actions, including community-based flood management in Thailand, water storage technology in Central America, fluoride in groundwater in Cameroon, and a water resources investment strategy for transboundary projects in the Orange-Senqu River Basin.The ’10 Stories of Impact’ report was released during theClimate Action Summitin New York, US, in September 2019.GWPwill launch a detailed program report on WACDEP at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Santiago, Chile, in 2019.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) Secretariat published an information note that examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on least developed countries’ (LDC) participation in global trade. The note highlights a “significant decline in export earnings” among LDCs since the outbreak of COVID-19, and calls for supporting LDCs’ participation in global trade through providing debt relief and strengthening social sectors.The note titled, ‘The COVID-10 Pandemic and Trade-related Developments in LDCs,’ finds that decreasing demand in key markets, declining commodity prices, and declining remittances have contributed to a decline in export earnings for LDCs. LDCs’ dependence on a limited range of products exported to few markets has compounded economic challenges, particularly in the textile and clothing product markets and countries dependent on tourism revenue. As an example, the number of tourists visiting Tanzania’s Serengeti fell from 6,000 per day to 24 following COVID-19. Overall, the note states, the 2020 downturn in trade is “likely to be even more severe for LDCs” than at the global level. The note warns that the pandemic has the potential to reverse LDCs’ development gains.The number of tourists visiting Tanzania’s Serengeti fell from 6,000 per day to 24 following COVID-19.There are currently 47 LDCs, 36 of which are WTO members and 12 of which are at different stages of the graduation process. The note finds, however, that the pandemic has the potential to negatively affect countries prospects for graduation. Angola and Vanuatu, which are scheduled to graduate, and Bangladesh, which is on the path to graduate in the next few years, have experienced “massive falls” in their export earnings and decreased remittances, which are likely to negatively impact their graduation prospects in the near term.LDCs are addressing the COVID-19 pandemic through various measures such as providing stimulus packages to export-oriented sectors, strengthening health care systems, and providing liquidity support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For example, Myanmar established a COVID-19 fund worth over USD 70 million to provide loans at one percent interest rate to SMEs, Lesotho has exempted businesses from a variety of taxes, including value-added tax (VAT), and Rwanda has expedited VAT refunds to SMEs. The WTO LDCs group has also called on other WTO members to refrain from imposing restrictions on medical goods and food and from imposing export prohibitions. Some LDCs have decreased duties on medical goods to provide them at more affordable prices for their citizens.The note summarizes international responses and support for LDCs, including emergency funding to fight the pandemic from international financial institutions (IFIs). The publication concludes that maintaining support measures for LDCs, including providing social safety nets for the most vulnerable and redoubling coordination efforts, is critical to economic recovery.

"17 July 2019: Twenty-five years have passed since the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) convened in Cairo, Egypt, resulting in the adoption of the Cairo Programme of Action, which called for promoting women’s empowerment by reducing inequalities and improving access to education, decent work and reproductive health care, among other actions.The Cairo Programme of Action recognizes that women’s rights and access to sexual and reproductive health are critical responses to demographic trends and their absence could undermine sustainable, equitable and inclusive development. Two hundred million women still lack access to reproductive health services and more than 800 women die every day from preventable causes during pregnancy and childbirth. Globally, around 650 million women were married as children.On 16 July 2019, a high-level UN General Assembly (UNGA) meeting in New York commemorated the 25-year anniversary. Speakers: called for donors and international organizations to address funding gaps to help countries implement the Programme of Action; stressed that since Cairo, maternal mortality has dropped by 44% and under-five mortality by 50%; said meeting the need for family planning by 2030 will cost USD 40 billion; and underscored that teenage pregnancies threaten achievement of SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 10 (reduced inequalities).UN Secretary-General António Guterreslamentedthat violence against women and girls still affects one in three women worldwide, with the number even higher during conflict and emergencies. He stated that many of the policies set out in the Cairo Programme of Action, including tackling inequality and environmental degradation, and promoting gender equality and access to sexual and reproductive health, are critical to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. He recalled that the Conference, for the first time, linked population, human rights, economic growth and sustainable development, addressing them in a holistic and coherent manner. While acknowledging that progress in women’s rights over the past 25 years has helped reduce poverty and hunger and improve education and health, Guterres also cited a “a global pushback” on women’s rights, including reproductive rights and health services.2019 also marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which has helped implement the Cairo Programme of Action and has been instrumental in: empowering youth and enabling women and couples to access sexual and reproductive health care; preventing gender-based violence; and tackling the issues of female genital mutilation and early marriage.From 12-14 November 2019, Kenya and Denmark, with the UNFPA, will conveneThe Nairobi Summit on ICPD25: Accelerating the promiseto mark the 25th anniversary of the Cairo Conference and to mobilize political and financial commitments.

"The Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, composed of thirty of the world’s largest investors representing USD 5 trillion in assets, has published for public consultation a protocol establishing five-year portfolio decarbonization targets, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.Convened by the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance brings together institutional investorscommittedto transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and to aligning them with the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1.5°C scenario.The ‘Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol’ lays out plans for reducing emissions, increasing investment in the net zero emissions transition, and enhancing influence on markets and government policy. The protocol gives alliance members the flexibility to employ a combination of approaches to achieve their unique decarbonization and engagement strategies.There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy.Alliance members will set individual portfolio targets during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in emissions reductions between 16-29% per member by 2025 from 2019 levels. Targets are designed to be “transparent and unique” to fit individual institutions while allowing aggregated progress to be tracked and reported.A UNEP FI press release highlights members’ dual goals of transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and achieving this through engaging on corporate action and public policies. Members do not seek to “engage in a divestment exercise,” rather they intend to engage with portfolio companies to assist them in adjusting their business models, UNEP FI notes.“Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy,” he noted, highlighting “new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead.”The Protocol is available forcommentfor one month, from 13 October till 13 November.Alliance members have also made commitments under other asset decarbonization initiatives, including theUN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C, the Science Based Targets Initiative for Financial Institutions (SBTIFI), the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII) of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and the Investor Agenda Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs). The draft protocol builds on the Net Zero Investment Framework, a draft investor guide for achieving net zero emissions by 2050,launchedby the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIPGG) in August 2020.

"26 September 2019: The UN Development Programme (UNDP), Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and partners launched a platform to help cities strategically manage challenges and learn from each other by sharing experiences and innovative solutions. The ‘City2City Network’ will provide a forum to find solutions to contemporary urban challenges and promote leadership, learning and innovation.The Network will focus on areas such as digital transformation, energy and climate change, resilience, governance, the informal economy and municipal financing for development (FfD).At least 110 of 169 SDG targets, a UNDP press release notes, will require direct engagement of cities and local authorities. The Network will serve as a peer-learning mechanism across regions, and engage the private sector, civil society and development partners by offering tools and diagnostics to support planning and SDG implementation at the local level.“The City2City Network is born out of the need to connect, share and innovate towards socially inclusive, resource-efficient and sustainable cities,” said Mourad Wahba, UNDP. Wahba noted that the Network will “capitalize on UNDP’s network of Accelerator Labs operating across 60 countries to further experimentation to solve urban development problems.”The Network, to be administered by UNDP, was launched on the sidelines of the74th sessionof the UN General Assembly (UNGA 74).

"The UN has published the 2020 edition of the World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) report. It draws attention to economic risks in 2020 posed by trade disputes, policy uncertainties, and political polarization. This political and economic climate, combined with rising global temperatures and more weather-related shocks, points to a clear need for “a dramatic shift in the global energy mix.”The WESP report is produced annually by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the five UN regional commissions.The authors of the 2020 report stress that a cleaner energy mix will mean benefits for human health and the environment. The transition can also bring economic opportunities, but careful policy strategies are needed to ensure an even distribution of the costs and benefits between and within countries.The energy sector currently emits three quarters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) globally, which means that the world’s growing energy needs must be met with renewable or low-carbon energy sources in order to combat climate change. In other words, expanding investment in oil, gas and coal-fired power is “short-sighted” and presents the risk of sudden losses, as well as environmental setbacks and increased global warming.The authors also note that weak global growth makes it harder to achieve the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. Launching the report, UN Chief Economist Elliott Harris called for policymakers to look beyond promoting GDP growth to investment in projects for education, renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure.

"10 July 2019: Despite technological and operational improvements planned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the international aviation sector, which contributes to 1.3% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is not on track to meet its emissions reduction targets. The proposed Recarbonization of Global Soils (RECSOIL) Facility aims to curb aviation sector CO2 emissions by supporting farming practices that boost soil organic carbon (SOC) for climate change mitigation and adaptation.According to analysis by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), agricultural and degraded soils have the potential to sequester more than 60 times the emissions generated by the aviation sector in 2018. With an estimated 33% of global soils characterized as degraded, “recarbonization” offers a solution for offsetting the projected rise of emissions in the international aviation industry, thus contributing to achievement of multiple SDG targets, including enhanced agricultural productivity and income for farmers (SDG target 2.3), food security and nutrition (SDG 2), and climate change resilience (SDG target 13.1).RECSOIL will provide incentives and technical training to encourage farmers to adopt effective soil organic carbon-centered practices.Presenting the rationale as well as operationalization modalities for the mechanism, the FAO publication titled, ‘Recarbonization of Global Soils: A Dynamic Response to Offset Global Emissions,’ explains that the aim is to scale up SOC-centered practices, while fostering other co-benefits of sustainable soil management. In particular, RECSOIL will seek to prevent further SOC losses from carbon-rich soils such as peatlands, black soils and permafrost and, where feasible, for example in agricultural and degraded soils, to increase SOC stocks. The facility also aims to contribute to the growth of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the aviation sector.RECSOIL will support activities at two broad levels. At the global level, the Facility will support the development of a SOC monitoring system linking national, regional and global reporting, including on progress in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the UNFCCC. On the ground, the facility will provide incentives and technical training to encourage farmers to adopt effective SOC-centered practices.The proposed RECSOIL facility is coordinated by the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) as part of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

"17 September 2019: The Government of India released a position paper outlining India’s perspective on climate finance. The document was issued to inform stakeholder deliberations under the Climate Finance and Carbon Pricing action area of the UN Secretary-General’sClimate Action Summiton 23 September.The paper titled, ‘Climate Summit for Enhanced Action: A Financial Perspective from India,’ outlines India’s efforts in diversifying its energy supply, increasing the share of non-fossil fuel energy in the total energy mix and enhancing the use of energy conservation technologies and practices. It notes that India’s mitigation and adaptation activities have resulted in a reduction in emission intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) “by 21% over the period 2005-2014.”At the same time, the document underscores that global climate action depends on the delivery of the means of implementation, particularly technology and timely and adequate finance, characterized by “scope, scale and speed.” It highlights climate finance as a “key pillar in enabling climate actions,” emphasizing that enhanced ambition and enhanced support “should be at equal footing.”The paper analyzes the issue of finance in climate treaties and Conference of the Parties (COP) decisions since the UNFCCC’s adoption in 1992, focusing, in particular, on post-2020 climate actions, the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) and the Talanoa Dialogue. It argues that climate finance delivery has been inadequate, lamenting the absence of a “tangential relationship” between commitments and ensuing actions. As an illustration, the paper cites climate-specific finance flows from developed to developing countries in 2016, which amounted to around USD 38 billion – less than 40% of the USD 100 billion per year target.Noting that India will “endeavor to do its best for adaptation and mitigation actions, keeping in mind the imperatives of sustainable development and poverty eradication,” the paper cautions that net zero emissions by 2050 “cannot be a goal for developing countries” due to the lack of adequate finance and technologies.The paper was produced by the Climate Change Finance Unit of the Department of Economic Affairs at India’s Ministry of Finance.

"The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) have announced a USD 10 million programme to build capacity for flood and drought forecasting in Somalia. The project is expected to promote water security and access for more than 360,000 farmers and pastoralists.The programme will establish Somalia’s first National Hydro-Meteorological and Monitoring Service, led by its Directorate of Environment and Climate Change in the Office of the Prime Minister and implemented by its Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. Activities under the project include weather monitoring, flood and drought forecasting, early warning, and training on flood management and water conservation.The project seeks to alleviate the impacts of climate-induced shocks such as floods, cyclones and drought. The GEF reports that such events have displaced 2.6 million people within the country, caused conflict over competition for water resources, and exacerbated food insecurity and unemployment. The agency also notes the links between water scarcity and social unrest, with the rise of militia groups such as Al-Shabaab.Speaking at the launch, UNDP Resident Representative Jocelyn Mason highlighted the relevance of the project to  Somalia’s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Besides the project’s relevance to climate action (SDG 13), Mason noted its potential benefits for poverty reduction (SDG 1), food security (SDG 2), gender equality (SDG 5), drinking water (SDG 6), and peace and security (SDG 16).The GEF is contributing USD 8.8 million to the four-year project from its Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), and UNDP is contributing a further USD 1.5 million. [GEF Press Release] [UNDP Press Release] [UNDP Climate Change Adaptation Press Release]",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
"TheFood Systems Dashboardis an interactive tool that allows users to compare and analyze over 150 indicators of food systems at the country level. It aims to support policymakers, researchers, and civil society to examine variables that determine the availability, value, and health consequences of food resources globally.The Dashboard was developed by the Johns Hopkins University and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), with collaborators at Harvard University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the Agriculture-Nutrition Community of Practice.Data on environmental factors will be added in January 2021.Most of the data in the Dashboard is open source. It is pooled from FAO, Euromonitor International, the World Bank, and other data sources.A “Compare and Analyze” feature allows users to explore indicators organized according to six clusters: food supply chains; food environments; individual factors; consumer behavior; diets and nutrition; and drivers. The Dashboard provides for visualizations and comparisons globally, regionally, and by country, food systems type, or income classification. The Dashboard also includes 41 indicators for each country to provide in-depth insights into the challenges and opportunities facing countries and their food systems.The Food Systems Dashboard aims to provide a complete view of food systems, with indicators related to natural resources, climate, agriculture, policy, commerce, and culture. It shows the types of foods that constitute the average diet, where foods are sold, and the effects of climate change, urbanization, and migration, among other factors.The Dashboard, which was launched in June 2020, is automatically updated as governments release new information.

"The New Climate Institute, in partnership with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) and on behalf of Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety (BMU), released a guide for policy makers with recommendations on how to approach developing a long-term low-greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategy.The report acknowledges that to achieve the objective of the Paris Agreement on climate change to hold the increase in global average temperature to “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, scientific evidence shows that it will be necessary to reach net-zero GHG emissions globally by 2050. Article 4 of the Paris Agreement calls on Parties to detail how they will achieve this objective by formulating and communicating long-term low-GHG emission development strategies (LTS) and providing regular five-year updates to countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).However, the report notes, neither the Paris Agreement nor the “Katowice Rulebook” specify requirements for the scope and format of an LTS, nor do they provide requirements for updating the LTS. The New Climate Institute’s guide provides recommendations for policy makers on how to approach the development of an LTS based on three key concepts.First, the guide recommends that the LTS undergo revision cycles every five years to coincide with a country’s NDC revisions. This will ensure that the country’s long-term vision and medium-term targets are aligned and that mitigation strategies are based on current science. TheMarshall Islands, Ukraine,France, and the Czech Republic have declared their intention to review and revise their LTSs at least every five years, the report notes.Second, to account for country-specific circumstances and starting points, the guide proposes that the development of an LTS be guided by “three levels of comprehensiveness”: base, intermediate, and detailed. The scope, depth, and robustness should be selected based on a nation’s access to the resources necessary to develop an LTS and can be enhanced in subsequent revision rounds.Third, the guide recommends that policy makers consider eight key aspects when developing their LTSs: process; theoretical long-term scenario analysis; long-term GHG and non-GHG targets; sectoral coverage; linking the LTS to immediate steps and interim targets as outlined in the NDC; the mobilization of finance and technology; sustainable development and just transition; and outlook.The guide was published under an International Climate Initiative (IKI) project, ‘Capacity Development for climate policy in the countries of South East, Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia, Phase III.’ [Publication:Making Long-Term Low GHG Emissions Development Strategies a Reality] [Publication Landing Page]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"16 September 2019: A World Bank report argues that developing countries need to “dramatically” increase agricultural innovation and the use of technology by farmers in order to eliminate poverty, meet the rising demand for food and adapt to climate change. The publication cautions that while new communication technologies make improving access to information, finance and insurance more feasible, small farmers still face major barriers.Titled, ‘Harvesting Prosperity: Technology and Productivity in Agriculture,’ the report is the fourth volume in the World Bank’s ‘Productivity Project’ series, which examines the “productivity paradox” – a persistent slowdown in productivity growth despite technological advancements. The report explores the drivers of and constraints to agricultural productivity and provides policy recommendations.The publication mentions that while in East Asia crop yields have increased six-fold in the past 40 years, contributing to the significant reduction in poverty in China and other East Asian countries, crop yields have only doubled in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia, with corresponding lower reductions in poverty. The report further notes a “widening research and development (R&D) spending gap.” In developed countries, investment in agricultural R&D was 3.25% of agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011; in developing countries, investment in agricultural R&D was only 0.52%. Among developing countries, the publication observes that Brazil and China invested “relatively high amounts” into agricultural R&D, while Africa and South Asia had the lowest spending relative to agricultural GDP. In half of African countries, the R&D spending was in decline.The report identifies the adoption of innovative technologies and practices by farmers as a “key driver” for increasing agricultural productivity and rising income. It explains that this would enable farmers to raise yields, manage inputs more efficiently, adopt new crops and production systems, and improve the quality of their products while conserving natural resources and adapting to climate challenges. Cautioning that climate change, coupled with a deteriorating natural resource base, will greatly impact agriculture and the poor and vulnerable depending on it, precisely in Africa and South Asia, the report makes the case for increasing investments in new knowledge and ensuring its adoption.To spur technological innovation and adoption in agriculture, the publication,inter alia,recommends:both public and private research and technology transfer to be taken into consideration by governments in strengthening their overall innovation system;repurposing the current public support for agriculture to revitalize public agricultural research systems by investing in agricultural higher education and creating the enabling conditions to leverage private sector R&D;the private sector to stimulate more rapid access to new technologies for farmers;reducing restrictions on market participation; andencouraging competition;The report also recommends removing onerous regulations and strengthening intellectual property rights.

"Over 1,000 manufactured chemicals used today are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including flame retardants, dioxins, UV-stabilizers, and toxic metals such as lead and cadmium, according to a report published by the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) and the Endocrine Society. The report is intended as a guide for public interest organizations and policymakers.Exposure is universal; almost everyone has EDCs in their bodies.The report titled, ‘Plastics, EDCs & Health,’ summarizes research on the health impacts of EDCs in plastics. Plastics contain and leach hazardous chemicals, including EDCs, which disturb the body’s hormone systems and can cause cancer, diabetes, reproductive disorders, and neurological damage in fetuses and children. The report points to a direct causal relationship between toxic chemical additives in plastics and impacts on the endocrine system.Lead author Jodi Flaws, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the US, said many plastics used on a daily basis are exposing us to a “harmful cocktail” of EDCs. Plastic containing EDCs is used in construction, food production and packaging, cookware, children’s toys, furniture, home electronics, textiles, automobiles, and cosmetics, among other common items.The report finds that 144 hazardous chemicals or chemical groups are used in plastics, and it describes seven harmful chemical types in detail. Bisphenols are used in reusable food and beverage containers, reusable water bottles, food can linings, medical and sports equipment, eyeglass lenses, thermal paper receipts, and plastic water pipes. Alkylphenols can be found in latex paints, pesticides, industrial cleaners, detergents, and personal care products. Phthalates are used to promote flexibility and reduce brittleness in plastics.Perfluorinated chemicals are used in water and stain-resistant clothing, food contact wrappers, lubricants, carpet treatments, paints, cookware, and other products. Flame retardants hep reduce flammability in plastic products. UV stabilizers protect plastic building materials, automotive parts, waxes, and paints from deterioration from UV radiation. Dioxins, for which no safe exposure levels exists, are byproducts of industrial and combustion processes and the production of plastic products.The report concludes that:Exposure can occur during the entire life span of plastic products;Exposure is universal and almost everyone has EDCs in their bodies;Microplastics contain chemical additives, which can bind and accumulate toxic chemicals from the environment and act as toxic compound carriers; andBiodegradable plastics, often promoted as more ecological than conventional plastics, contain similar chemical additives and have endocrine-disrupting effects.IPEN Co-Chair Pamela Miller said plastic production is projected to increase by 30-36% over the next six years, which will exacerbate EDC exposure and increase endocrine disease rates. She called for global policies to reduce and eliminate EDCs from plastic and reduce exposure from plastic recycling, plastic waste, and incineration. She identified EDCs in plastics as an international health issue, particularly in the global south where “toxic plastic waste shipments from wealthier countries inundate communities.”The Endocrine Society, founded in 1916, undertakes research on hormones and the clinical practice of endocrinology, and is comprised of over 18,000 scientists, physicians, educators, nurses, and students in more than 100 countries.

"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has published research on the keys to ensuring that women take leadership roles in political, economic and public life (SDG target 5.5). The report recommends that governments and others support four pathways for women: education and consciousness raising; access to resources and opportunities; laws and policies such as quotas and gender-based budgeting; and ending discriminatory practices.The 102-page report titled, ‘Pathways to Influence: Promoting the Role of Women’s Transformative Leadership to Achieve the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific,’ discusses the quality and impact of women’s leadership, arguing that women’s leadership can lead to the kind of transformative change that is envisaged in the 2030 Agenda. According to the report, SDG target 5.5 is a driver for progress on other targets on gender equality; women’s presence in government leads to higher turnout of women voters, increased gender-sensitive policies, including in social, health and safety services, and greater profits in business.Women’s presence in government leads to higher turnout of women voters, increased gender-sensitive policies and greater profits in business.The authors draw on numerical data, prior qualitative research and in-depth interviews with 17 women leaders from 14 countries. They find that the gender gap in the Asia-Pacific region remains large: inhibiting factors include the risks of violence and harassment of women, the disproportionate burden of unpaid household and care work; and “imposter syndrome,” which is experienced  even by high-achieving women accustomed to being in the public spotlight. In 2019, women ministers represented just 12% of all ministerial posts in the region, and women in parliament accounted for 20% of all parliamentarians.ESCAP’sinterviews with women leadersin the region, undertaken for this report, highlight the importance of women having: access to productive resources, such as agricultural land; a supportive family environment and positive role models; informal opportunities to take leadership roles, for example, in faith-based organizations and member associations; and temporary special measures such as gender quotas for parliaments.The authors caution that, while leadership development courses can be useful for women, such initiatives need to be contextualized to take account of local conditions and processes. They also note that challenging gender-based norms will require the involvement of men as well as women.The report was prepared under the auspices of the UN Regional Coordination Mechanism Thematic Working Group on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women.

The three countries emphasized the importance of the SDGs and the ongoingWTO negotiations for a multilateral agreement on investment facilitation for development, where 105 WTO members are participating.Members also highlighted that the Aid for Trade initiative can help mobilize resources to improve FDI flows, particularly into developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). Underscoring the importance of addressing FDI in the SVE group and other emerging economies, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said small economies represent only a 1.3% global share of FDI inflows, and FDI to the SVE countries decreased by 17% in the first half of 2020.Meeting participants also flagged the recent jointcommunicationby Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, and the US, which urges all WTO members to advance implementation of the TFA in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The communication points to the TFA’s implementation as already resulting in improved customs efficiency and transparency, and commits to accelerated actions in areas of,inter alia, pre-arrival processing,  expedited shipments and border agency cooperation.The meeting convened on 2 November 2020.

"26 August 2019: World Water Week, which convened on the theme of ‘Water for Society: Including All,’ launched a Water Scarcity Clock. The clock, a web-based tool, provides information relevant to SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) targets along with visualizations of national-level data on countries’ levels of water stress, water scarcity and absolute water scarcity.Developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the World Data Lab, and the German development agency GIZ, theWater Scarcity Clockis meant to give policy makers real-time information and provide visualizations of predicted water stress and scarcity globally, in 2030. Its data is particularly relevant to SDG 6 targets on drinking water (target 6.1), sanitation (target 6.2), water quality (target 6.3) and water-use efficiency (target 6.4).IIASAnotesthat water stress, defined as less than 1,700 cubic meters of water per person a year, is already a serious issue in 22 countries, particularly in North Africa and Western, Central and South Asia, where more than 70% of the population currently experiences water stress. Absolute water scarcity is defined as levels of less than 1,000 cubic meters per person a year. The Institute warns that future water scarcity will also affect some industrialized countries: in Australia, for example, more than 26% of the population experienced water stress in 2016, and this proportion is anticipated to rise by 2030.At World Water Week, Peter Eriksson, Sweden’s Minister for International Development Cooperation, called for better water governance, and warned that water scarcity is likely to increase inequalities and affect food security.Organized by the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI),World Water Weekis an annual platform for many different water agencies to showcase their work and draw attention to emerging issues. This year, high-level speakersdrew attentionto the importance of water for prosperity and poverty eradication, as well as for action on climate change. Participants also highlighted, inter alia, issues relevant to sound water management, including recognition of the rights of nature, data availability and transparency, and indigenous people’s rights and roles in ecosystem management.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The illegal trade of chemicals is the subject of a report from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), which highlights knowledge gaps and enforcement challenges related to the regulating trade in toxic, hazardous, and severely restricted chemicals.The report titled, ‘The Illegal Trade in Chemicals,’ was released on 1 April 2020. In discussing the governance and markets of the illegal chemicals and waste trade, the authors review enforcement failures and best practices, and provide recommendations for policymakers, as well as for communities and users of chemicals.According to the publication, multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) regulate only a fraction of the chemicals being traded, amid exemptions under MEAs and inconsistencies among domestic regulations. The authors report that many toxic products are easily accessible in the marketplace or online, and a lack of reporting mechanisms means that information on illegal trade is scarce and hinders the ability of authorities to act.The report provides a particular focus on the illegal trade of pesticides and mercury, both of which are subject to strong international regulations. However, the scale of illegal trade in these chemicals is unknown, and users of the substances are often unaware of the risks they pose. The authors suggest that public-private partnerships can help raise awareness among vendors, local farmers, rural communities, and private landowners about the health and environmental risks associated with pesticides. They also find that:annual revenue losses of €1.3 billion in the legitimate pesticides industry in the EU are attributable to counterfeit pesticides;an estimated 30% of pesticides sold in developing countries are sub-standard;half of all mercury used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is traded illegally; andthe value of illegally-traded mercury is USD 100–215 million annually.Legitimate businesses, national economies, and human health and the environment are bearing the brunt of the illegal chemicals trade, write the authors. They recommend: building expertise and capacity to identify illegal shipments; establishing national reporting mechanisms to assess illegal trade within national jurisdictions; better controlling the production and marketing of gold and the harmonization of gold-export regimes to reduce the drivers of illicit cross-border trade; and standardized regional mercury-specific trade frameworks and anti-corruption campaigns at the local and national levels.A challenge to reducing illegal chemicals trade is that law enforcement officers are not adequately trained or equipped to detect and recognize illicit chemicals and counterfeit containers. Shipping documents may not report mercury concealed among other materials, or mercury may be delivered in secret to a small port by fishing boat.The report recommendsthat policymakers work to ensure the availability of human and technical resources to combat illegal trade, including to maintain staffing levels and train law enforcement officers to identify and interdict illicit movements of hazardous chemicals, and developing intelligence systems for sharing information among agencies and the coordinating transnational enforcement operations.The report was prepared by UNEP andGRID-Arendalin partnership with the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), the Center for Environmental Law (CIEL), INTERPOL and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), among others.

"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has launched a Knowledge Hub on Statistics for SDGs to help countries develop and communicate statistics on the SDGs, and formulate and evaluate evidence-driven policies. The Knowledge Hub is the first part of the UNECE Regional Platform on Statistics for the SDGs.SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) recognizes the essential role of data and statistics in achieving the SDGs. SDG target 17.18 calls for increased availability and quality of data, and SDG target 17.19 recommends statistical capacity building for improved measurement of progress.In line with these targets, UNECE’s Knowledge Hub, launched on 3 December 2019, seeks to contribute to coordination and promotion of statistically sound methodology. The Hub is also a direct response to a declaration adopted by European chief statisticians at a conference in 2015. The ‘Declaration on the role of national statistical offices in measuring and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals,’ adopted by the Conference of European Statisticians (CES), calls on national governments to support national statistical offices (NSOs) in measuring and monitoring the SDGs, underscores the importance of high-quality statistics in informed decision-making, and acknowledges the importance of sharing experience and learning from each other to monitor and report on the SDGs.The Knowledge Hub provides producers of national official statistics and other statistical experts with a set of guidelines and tools, including a practical guide to developing national reporting platforms and tools for countries to conduct self-assessments of their data and indicator availability. The Knowledge Hub also compiles summaries of progress in producing SDG indicators across UNECE countries, and shares work on national reporting platforms, statistical capacity development and data flows. The platform highlights global, regional and national events and initiatives.Countries also can use the Hub to share technical materials. For instance, Ireland has shared its code and shapefiles for combining geospatial and statistical data.In addition to the Knowledge Hub, the UNECE Regional Platform on Statistics for the SDGs will include a database on SDG indicators, presented through an interactive dashboard. UNECE anticipates launching the dashboard in March 2020, in advance of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

"Aware that hyper consumption must gradually be replaced by more qualitative and participatory approaches, a growing number of forest concession holders are looking at more sustainable ways of managing tropical forests. This responsible approach has resulted in the creation of the Fair&Precious collective brand, which aims to encourage European consumers to purchase products that use ecological and responsibly-sourced materials.Fair&Precious, the collective label for legal and eco-certified African timber, is an international initiative in line with the UN’s sustainable development agenda.To be a member of Fair&Precious, concession holders must, at the very least, be FSC or PEFC certified. These labels are controlled by certification bodies such as Bureau Veritas and are there to guarantee the application of strict rules to ensure the traceability of material from the forest to the finished product. In addition, each member must follow 10 very clear commitments*, which are in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 10 commitments constitute the Fair&Precious manifesto.Fair&Precious concession holders devote significant budgets to ensuring that these commitments are respected. In this way, they can create a virtuous dynamic, so that good practices take precedence above all else. The Fair&Precious community relies on dialogue and mutual respect while working in the field on a daily basis, to ensure that human development is carried out in harmony with the forest.By creating the Fair&Precious label, ATIBT (International Tropical Timber Technical Association) and its members want to show that they are fully committed to the CSR approach that integrates major environment criteria, respect for local populations and communities, ecosystem conservation and protection of species.European consumers know very little about the role of these concession holders, to whom they attribute the disappearance of forests when in fact they are their best protector. It is time for consumers to know that sustainable solutions exist in the world of tropical wood management.The Fair&Precious brand makes up for the lack of awareness about its certified members who each offer models that respect people and the planet, while promoting an exceptional material.*Fair&Precious’ 10 commitments through its manifesto1. Manage and protect forests to combat climate change2. Preserve forest resources by harvesting less than naturally grows3. Develop knowledge on biodiversity to facilitate the restocking of species4. Ensure the maintenance of the wildlife’s living space5. Implement programmes to combat environmental crime against fauna and flora6. Contribute to the well-being of populations by facilitating their access to education, health care and housing7. Stimulate the economies of producing countries by enhancing the value of forests and promoting local wood processing8. Set up training courses in forestry and woodworking professions9.

"An illustrated handbook on the New Urban Agenda presents the agenda’s proposals and commitments in the form of diagrams and illustrations, highlighting connections and correlations. The publication from UN-Habitat also presents the concept of “spatial sustainability” as a fourth dimension that builds on the other three: social, economic, and environmental sustainability.The New Urban Agenda was adopted at Habitat III in Quito, Ecuador, on 20 October 2016, and endorsed by the UN General Assembly in December 2016.In the New Urban Agenda, the four dimensions of sustainability form a lens to collectively improve urban planning and development. The concept of spatial sustainability focuses on the physical form of a city as a result of intentional planning and development. It suggests that a city’s spatial conditions affect its ability to generate social, economic, and environmental value and well-being: “Governments can achieve spatial sustainability by guiding the physical form of urban environments to create equitable access to jobs, housing and social interactions; enable agglomeration economies and encourage sustainable relationships to ecosystems and natural habitats.”The illustrated handbook notes that the New Urban Agenda is intended as an accelerator of the SDG framework, in particular Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities), by guiding and tracking urbanization around the world. However, as UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif says in her foreword, the world is “not on track to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 11.” The handbook thus aims to make the global framework more accessible and user-friendly both for policymakers and practitioners. As Sharif explains, “We need a more hands-on approach to scale and accelerate our actions.”Upon the launch of the illustrated guide, the IUCN Urban Alliancewrites that“the NUA in its original form was found wanting in terms of accessibility, poetic charm and real-life examples. The illustrative guide, however, adeptly addresses these limitations. It gives greater sense, structure and substance to the issues, challenges and solutions laid out in the NUA while forging neat alignment with the SDGs.”UN-Habitat also announced the creation of the ‘Urban Agenda Platform,’ an online knowledge portal of voluntary national reports, best practices, actions, data, training, and resources on the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and urban-related SDGs. The portal aims to inform the UN Secretary-General’s periodic reports on progress in implementing the New Urban Agenda.

"August 2019: The Government of Chile, which is leading the Mitigation Strategy coalition for the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, has issued a call to rally ambition prior to the 23 September event in New York, US.Chilean Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, who will preside over the UN Climate Change Conference in Santiago, Chile, in December, is leading theMitigation Strategy, with support from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator Achim Steiner, to help mobilize action and commitments from all stakeholders and determine ways to keep warming below 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, which is also required to achieve the SDGs. Together, the coalition leaders are urging efforts towards “a bold and comprehensive mitigation strategy” that acknowledges the need for long-term solutions to climate change.The only way to tackle climate change is through universal commitment.The Mitigation Strategy seeks to generate momentum for ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term low-emission development strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.In a letter, Chilean High-Level Champion for Climate Action, Gonzalo Muñoz Abogabir, urged more actors to join the Mitigation Coalition prior to the Climate Action Summit, and requested help in bringing together actors from various networks and coalitions through theMarrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. Muñoz Abogabir is responsible for engaging with non-state actors ahead of the Summit and in the lead-up to the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC, with the aim of recognizing actors who have presented plans to be carbon neutral by 2050, and welcoming new actors who want to increase their ambition.UNFCCC Executive Secretary Espinosa has reiterated the need to present enhanced NDCs and long-term strategies that achieve net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. Chilean Environment Minister Schmidt said the only way to tackle climate change is through universal commitment, taking into account differing circumstances and priorities, and sub-national entities and non-state actors in addition to governments.

"22 September 2019: On the eve of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, 15 world leaders, led by the Marshall Islands, issued a statement, committing to update their emissions reduction targets by early 2020, and, by the end of 2020, to produce long-term strategies (LTSs) aimed at achieving net zero global emissions by 2050.In thestatementtitled, ‘Uniting Behind the Science to Step Up Ambition by 2020,’ the Heads of State and Government of the Marshall Islands, Belize, Costa Rica, Denmark, Fiji, Grenada, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Saint Lucia, Sweden, Switzerland and Vanuatu express their conviction that limiting global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels is fundamental to minimizing and averting the “severe, multiple and interrelated risks” climate change poses to human, land, ocean and terrestrial ecosystems.For the first time, a group of countries is saying they will unequivocally increase their Paris targets by next year.Responding to the UN Secretary-General’s call for Member States to submit concrete plans to enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2020 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45% over the next decade and move to net zero emissions by 2050, the leaders “resolve” to communicate, by the first quarter of 2020, new and updated NDCs for 2030, representing the highest possible level of ambition. They also commit, by 2020, to submit their long-term low-emission development strategies aimed at achieving net zero global emissions by 2050.The leaders also express support for an “ambitious and successful” replenishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and call on all governments and stakeholders to accelerate and strengthen action on climate change by 2020 by maintaining the momentum from the Climate Action Summit through to the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC in December 2019.In her comments, President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heine, said the Statement represents the first time “a group of countries is saying they will follow the Marshall Islands’ lead and unequivocally increase their Paris targets by next year and also put in place plans to achieve net zero global emissions by 2050.”All of the Statement signatories are members of the Marshall Islands-led High Ambition Coalition, which provides a political forum for coordinating progressive international action on climate change.

"TheLancetjournal has published astudythat explores pathways to achieve SDG target 3.4 (By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being). The study finds that premature mortality from NCDs is declining in most countries, but the rate of change is not enough to achieve the 2030 objective.The study was conducted by NCD Countdown 2030 collaborators. This collaboration seeks to inform policies, track progress, and enhance accountability towards reducing the burden of NCDs. The authors highlight that “non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death and ill health and account for seven of ten deaths worldwide.” They note that the risk of dying from NCDs varies across countries, which “suggests that countries might need to take different routes towards achieving SDG target 3.4 by addressing different combinations of diseases.” The study evaluates combinations of feasible reductions in specific NCDs to achieve the target and finds that each country has one or more pathways to achieve it.The research focuses on the indicator used to measure progress towards SDG target 3.4. This indicator assesses the cumulative probability of dying from cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes (four NCDs) between 30-70 years of age. The study uses data on cause-specific mortality for these NCDs to characterize the risk and trends in NCD mortality in each country, and then evaluates combinations of reductions in NCD causes of death that can achieve the SDG target.Based on data from 2010-16, women in 17 of 176 countries and men in 15 of 176 countries are expected to achieve SDG target 3.4. At the other end of the spectrum, the data from this time period show that the the probability of dying from one of the four NCDs for 30-70 year olds has stagnated or increased among women in 14 countries and men in 20 countries.According to the study, no country could achieve SDG target 3.4 by addressing only one NCD. Half the countries will require improvements in the rate of decline in at least five causes for women and in at least seven causes for men. The study reports that in order to achieve this target, the following interventions are needed in order to reduce NCD causes of death:tobacco and alcohol control and effective health-system interventions, including hypertension and diabetes treatment;primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in high-risk individuals;low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;treatment of acute cardiovascular diseases, diabetes complications, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; andeffective cancer screening and treatment.The study highlights that “reducing the burden of NCDs to achieve SDG target 3.4 requires a combination of prevention, early detection, and treatment.” It suggests that national NCD strategies should be based on the combination of local epidemiology and feasibility as well as an accessible and equitable health system. [Publication:NCD Countdown 2030: pathways to achieving Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"13 September 2019: The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and Pittsburgh’s Green Building Alliance (GBA) have launched the International Centre of Excellence on High Performance Buildings. The Centre will promote best practices in design, construction, policy and training into scalable solutions, with the aim of catalyzing economies based on equitable opportunity and human health.As an International Centre, Pittsburgh’s GBA will disseminate and deploy UNECE’s ‘Framework Guidelines for Energy Efficiency Standards in Buildings.’ According to Scott Foster, Director of Sustainable Energy, UNECE, improving the energy performance of buildings “stands out” among all the approaches to addressing climate change.Buildings are responsible for 40% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from combustion, and developing countries need to develop buildings for an anticipated 2.4 billion new urban residents by 2050. Beyond reducing the buildings’ carbon footprint, Foster said improving the energy performance of buildings will “enhance quality of life, reduce energy bills, improve health, create jobs and encourage innovation.” UNECE’s work on sustainable energy focuses on improving access to affordable and clean energy for all (SDG 7) and supporting commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change (SDG 13).GBA Executive Director, Jenna Cramer, explained that International Centres “transform how we build cities,” including the design and construction of buildings and the materials used. She said the Centres champion innovation, transition the workforce towards a healthier future and can help “set new standards for the future.”Pittsburgh’s International Centre follows New York City’s Building Energy Exchange, which was the first Centre of Excellence tasked with deploying the UNECE’s Framework Guidelines. The Pittsburgh Centre is a collaboration among regional partners, including the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, and contributes to and benefits from the global network of centres.

"11 September 2019: Climate change threatens the economies of commodity-dependent developing countries, according to a report published by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The report argues that these countries need to diversify economies and exports to avoid economic collapse.The 2019 edition of the UNCTAD Commodities and Development Report titled, ‘Commodity Dependence, Climate Change and the Paris Agreement,’ seeks to enhance understanding of the interactions between climate change and the commodity sectors. Climate change, the report finds, has increased the risk for commodity-dependent developing countries since they often rely on sectors that are exposed to extreme weather events. The report contends that in such countries, economic and export diversification is the best response to the climate challenge.Speaking about the publication, UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said that countries must assess their diversification potential and reduce their commodity dependence, which has left them exposed to volatile markets and climate change.Countries must reduce their commodity dependence, which has left them exposed to volatile markets and climate change.Small island developing States (SIDS) are among the worst affected, according to the report. Rising sea surface temperatures pose risks to SIDS that benefit from export earnings from fisheries, such as Kiribati, Maldives and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The negative impacts of climate change on crop and fisheries production are more severe in low-latitude regions, where most commodity-dependent developing countries are located, the report observes.The publication notes that fossil fuel-dependent countries, such as Brunei Darussalam, Kuwait and Qatar, are being affected by the push towards greener energy sources. In addition to underscoring the need for commodity-dependent countries to adapt, diversify and modernize their economies, the report says they must adapt to the effects of climate change response measures undertaken by other countries as well, which will reduce demand for some commodities on which they depend.The report also highlights opportunities for commodity-dependent developing countries that tackle climate change. For example, the trend towards renewable energy and energy efficiency can help countries with reserves of resources used in clean technologies, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, wind turbines and electric vehicle batteries. As an illustration, in 2018, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accounted for 58% of the global supply of cobalt, which is used to produce electric vehicle batteries, while Chile and Argentina jointly accounted for 71% of global reserves of lithium, also a battery component.Climate action has also led to investments in technological innovations that could benefit commodity-dependent countries, including the adoption of cost-efficient solar PV cells, which could bolster energy security and support commodity sectors in remote areas not connected to national power grids.Additionally, the report calls for,inter alia: reforming fossil fuel subsidies to further green fiscal policies, given that the wealthiest 20% of households in developing countries receive 43% of fossil fuel subsidy benefits, while the poorest 20% only receive 7%; and financial and technical support from developed countries to help commodity-dependent developing countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

"The 56th session of the International Tropical Timber Council (ITTC) and the Associated Sessions of its four Committees convened virtually from 9-13 November 2020. The Council discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tropical forests and timber, and debated whether to extend the treaty that governs the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO).As reported by theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, the Council session opened with the preliminary findings of an ITTO study on the impacts of the pandemic on the tropical forest sector and the tropical timber industry. The report notes that the entire timber and forest products sector was affected by severe drops in consumption, production, employment, and trade, but tropical timber and products were hit even harder.“Many enterprises are failing, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, and unemployment, rising poverty, and reverse migration (from urban to rural) is putting new pressure on forests and their resources. Supply chains have been disrupted, and the resulting changes may completely reshape supply and value chains in the post-pandemic period. The bottom line, suggests the ITTO study, is that tropical timber may not recover until 2026,” according to ENB. One delegation noted the need for strong ITTO leadership over the next 12-24 months.The Council also debated whether to extend the 2006 treaty that governs the ITTO, the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006, which is due to expire in December 2021. The treaty expires on 7 December 2021 unless the Council decides to extend, renegotiate, or terminate it.ENB reports that delegates who spoke indicated support for extending the Agreement for another five years, but some Member States said they would need time to complete domestic and legal consultations before they could formally agree on such a decision. This decision was postponed until ITTC-57, which will meet just before the deadline for the treaty to expire.The Council also adopted the ITTO Biennial Work Programme for 2021-2022, and decisions on:the next phase of the ITTO’s New Financing Architecture, instituting a programmatic approach to financing and streamlined project cycle;the extension of the current ITTO Strategic Action Plan (SAP) through 2021 so the ITTO Secretariat can prepare and present a new draft SAP; andthe selection of the next ITTO Executive Director.The Council Chair said the adoption of five key decisions during the meeting was due to rebuilt trust between the caucuses and a restored “sense of family” within the ITTO. As reported by ENB, the pledging of USD 3.5 million during ITTC-56, “most of it from ITTO’s traditionally largest donor, Japan, that had withheld donations in the wake of ITTO’s financial impairment scandal, plus the news that some USD 40 million may be forthcoming soon from various pending funding proposals, helped buttress this sense that ITTO is slowly but steadily making its comeback.”The Council agreed to convene its next session from 2-7 November 2021 in the ITTO host city, Yokohama, Japan.

"The Government of Costa Rica has become the 14th country to submit its long-term strategy for low-emission development (LTS) to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The LTS conveys Costa Rica’s aspiration to be a modern, green and emissions-free economy, and commits the country to net-zero emissions by 2050.Costa Rica’s ‘National Decarbonization Plan 2018-2050’ lays out the process for achieving these objectives, and explains that while the country has natural capital, education and openness, its transition to net-zero emissions could be slowed by shortcomings in infrastructure, including in the transport sector, and fiscal constraints.Involving every sector of the economy, the LTS is structured along ten decarbonization axes derived from the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions patterns, and correspond with the major emission sources. These axes relate to:developing a mobility system based on safe, efficient and renewable public transport, and on active mobility schemes;transforming light-duty vehicles to zero emissions;promoting cargo transport that adopts modalities, technologies and sources of zero or lowest possible emissions;consolidating the national electric system with capacity, flexibility, intelligence and resilience to supply and manage cost-competitive renewable energy;developing buildings for different uses under high-efficiency standards and low emission processes;transforming the industrial sector through processes and technologies that use energy from renewable sources or low or zero-emissions methods;developing an integrated waste management system based on the separation, reuse, revaluation and disposal with maximum efficiency and low emissions;promoting efficient agro-food systems that generate low carbon, local consumption and export goods;consolidating a livestock model based on productive efficiency and emission reductions; andconsolidating a land management model that facilitates biodiversity protection, forest cover increases and maintenance, and ecosystem services based on nature-based solutions.For each axis, the Plan suggests: a vision of transformation; short-, medium- and long-term measures or activities; and policy packages that combine planning, institutional or regulatory measures, implementation, access to financing, citizen support and avoiding lock-in.The Plan identifies eight cross-cutting strategies, including: comprehensive reform for the new institutionality of the bicentennial, which Costa Rica is celebrating in 2021; green tax reform; funding strategy and investment attraction; digitalization and knowledge-based economic strategy; just transition labor strategies; inclusion, human rights and gender equality; metric and open data systems to evaluate progress; and education and culture strategy.The Plan identifies five priorities for action, to be implemented immediately: triggering the transformation of public transport; accelerating and scaling up transformation actions of the agricultural sector’s higher emitting activities; laying the foundations of the electrification of the economy in the transport and industrial sectors; avoiding technological pathways in energy and transport that do not eliminate emissions; and starting the process of two cross-cutting reforms, a structural reform that will lay the foundations for a new sustainable consumption and production system, and a green tax reform that reduces the negative externalities that deteriorate natural capital.Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, all Parties are expected to “strive” to formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low emission development strategies (LEDS) to the UNFCCC Secretariat by 2020.

The resources provided by several UN-Water Members and Partners overview the key ways in which water and sanitation are key to stopping the virus.Many of the resources address the importance of hand washing, specifically hand washing with soap. Theynotethat only three out of five people worldwide have basic hand washing facilities.Articles regarding the importance of water and sanitation for vulnerable groups,such asrefugees, migrants, and stateless, are featured. In herarticle, Cecilia Jimenez-Damary, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, calls attention to the needs of internally displaced persons, noting that they are at “heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to limited access to healthcare, water, sanitation, food and adequate housing, and often face discrimination.”In anotherarticle, UN-Habitat addresses the need for water to wash hands in slums. To meet this challenge, the UN agency suggests introducing emergency safe drinking water and hand washing facilities in key locations in informal settlements and high-density public places. It also recommends engaging community leaders and groups through existing slum networks, youth centers, as well as using networks to train community volunteers and establish and manage hand washing facilities.Guidelines specific to water and sanitation measures, and infection prevention, forschools,households and public places, andhealth care facilitiesare also provided.

"During a four-day virtual meeting, the Chemical Review Committee (CRC) of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade finalized its work on two industrial chemicals. The CRC agreed to recommend that the Conference of the Parties (COP) make both chemicals subject to the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure.The PIC Procedure is a mechanism for obtaining and disseminating importing parties’ decisions on whether they wish to receive future shipments of certain chemicals, and for ensuring compliance with these decisions by exporting parties. If the COP agrees to the recommendation of the CRC, importers will be notified prior to trade in the industrial chemicals decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts and PFOA-related compounds.As reported by theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, decaBDE is used as a flame retardant in a wide variety of products, including electronic equipment, textiles, mattresses, vehicles, and construction materials. It has been found to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic to humans and wildlife, and it can be released into the environment during production, use, and disposal of items containing it. PFOA and its related compounds are used in products such as non-stick cookware, stain-resistant carpets, and fabrics.During itsvirtual meeting, from 8-11 September 2020, the Chemical Review Committee focused on time-sensitive technical work that had been initiated at its 2019 meeting. In addition to discussions on listing the two industrial chemicals, participants also discussed updates to the Handbook of Working Procedures and Policy Guidance for the CRC and considered how to enhance effective participation by members.The next meeting of the CRC is expected to consider at least eight chemicals.

"A high-level event during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference addressed what it means to realize a circular economy in various sectors, and highlighted key solutions to reach net zero emissions across all sectors by 2050. The dialogue was organized by ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).The Low-Emissions Solutions Conference (LESC) Dinner Dialogue took place on 9 December 2019, on the sidelines of the 25th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 25) in Madrid, Spain.Sachs warned against the “big lie” that net-zero emissions commitments hurt the economy.In opening remarks, ICLEI President Ashok Sridharan highlighted the ICLEI Green Circular Cities Coalition. SDSN Director Jeffrey Sachs underscored the need to pressure governments to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050, and warned against the “big lie” that such commitments are detrimental to the economy. In a keynote address, Peter Bakker, WBCSD President and CEO, said policymakers must: put a price on carbon; better manage climate risks; and end fossil fuel subsidies.In a dialogue session on a systems approach to mitigating emissions, a number of participants urged the decarbonization of production and the electrification of consumption. They also suggested considering the behavioral changes required for transitioning towards a circular economy. Speakers also highlighted: the role of the financial sector in mobilizing the capital to achieve net zero emissions; the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Global Platform on Sustainable Cities, under which businesses and local authorities are working together despite political constraints; that lengthy climate negotiations have the “advantage” of creating frustration in the private sector, which drives change in business models to address climate change; that the Paris Agreement on climate change was a first step towards a massive societal transformation and a new political environment; and that Brazil’s private sector is taking the lead in lobbying for better government regulation that would embrace carbon pricing.A second dialogue session considered what the circular economy means for the energy, buildings, transport, water and industrial sectors. Participants cited the need for cooperation across sectors to develop new solutions, calling for systemic rather than sectoral transformations.Bill Peduto, Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, said his city’s recovery model, which was applied following an economic crash, is in jeopardy due to petrochemical companies seeking to relocate to the region. Minna Arve, Mayor of Turku, Finland, said her city has been able to reduce emissions by 30% from 1990 levels while maintaining economic growth.

"4 September 2019: The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released a report finding that “concerted global efforts are required” to better distribute gains from the digital economy and minimize the digital divide. The report recommends increasing assistance to support countries that are lagging behind, building capacities in the public and private sectors, and strengthening the enabling environment for value creation.Digital developments have implications for virtually all of the SDGs, and will affect all countries, sectors and stakeholders.The ‘Digital Economy Report 2019’ finds that the digital economy is highly concentrated in the US and China, while the rest of the world is “trailing considerably far behind,” especially countries in Africa and Latin America. In the least developed countries (LDCs), one in five people use the internet, compared with four out of five people in developed countries. The US and China account for 90% of the market capitalization value of the world’s 70 largest digital platforms, over 75% of the cloud computing market, 75% of all patents related to blockchain technologies, and 50% of global spending on the Internet of Things (IoT). Under current regulations and policies, the report predicts that this trajectory is likely to continue, contributing to increasing inequality.UN Secretary-General António Guterres stressed the importance of closing this digital divide in the report’s forward: “Inclusivity is essential to building a digital economy that delivers for all.” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi highlighted the desire of people in developing countries to “take part in the new digital world, not just as users and consumers, but also as producers, exporters and innovators.” He said inclusion in the digital world can help to create and capture more value and promote inclusive prosperity. The report showcases how digital data and digital platforms can help drive value creation in the digital economy.The report states that digital developments “have implications for virtually all of the SDGs” and will affect all countries, sectors and stakeholders. The report highlights how digital data can help solve society’s problems and contribute to the SDGs by improving economic and social outcomes and serving as a force for innovation and productivity growth.

"UN-Water is preparing to launch the ‘SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework’ to support country progress on clean water and sanitation. Members and partners met for an online consultation on the launch, which will take place on the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2020.The Framework will support accelerated country progress in five key areas of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): financing; data and information; capacity development; innovation; and governance. Among other activities, UN-Water envisions the Framework to include efforts to scale up innovative practices and technologies, and to build trust through data generation, validation, and standardization.During the virtual meeting on 11 June 2020, Peter Singer, Special Advisor to the Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), reviewed lessons learned from theGlobal Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All. Singer noted that an acceleration framework seeks to identify how the multilateral system can work together to speed progress. He said such a framework should not be specific to one SDG, but rather should create an enabling environment that builds a culture of collaboration.Singer identified five lessons that have been learned through the Global Action Plan focused on SDG 3:UN agencies can help governments, but the focus must be on how national leaders can work together better and develop ownership at all levels;developing communities of practice around specific issues adds value to the Plan;learn by doing, gather empirical evidence, and step back after nine months to identify where clusters of activity are forming and evaluate different levels of progress;incentives matter, within and among organizations; andbring a heavy COVID-19 lens to the acceleration framework, because it is changing the way we work together.Participants on the call were briefed on plans for the “SDG 6 Action Space,” which will be one of the accountability measures for the Framework. This virtual space will be hosted on the UN-Waterwebsiteand will seek to inform users about the Framework and other stakeholders’ resources. It will also have a space to record individual commitments, to provide others with ideas for the types of action they can take.

"25 September 2019: The Power of Nutrition, an independent charitable foundation, and Lifebuoy, Unilever’s hygiene soap brand, have announced a partnership to reduce child stunting and improve nutrition in India.Noting that approximately 50% of malnutrition is linked to poor water, sanitation and hygiene, the collaboration aims to help approximately 2.7 million women in India to improve nutrition and hygiene in their families by 2021. The partners will employ a mobile programme called Mobile Doctarni created by lifebuoy to deliver time sensitive health and hygiene information to women and children in hard-to-reach areas.The partnership, which supports the Government of India’s initiative to address under-nutrition in the country, was launched at the Concordia Annual Summit, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, US. The partners aim to create a model programme that could be replicated in other parts of the world.Speaking on the partnership, Anila Gopal, Global Social Mission Director at Unilever said that “Unilever are committed to using the company’s scale, knowledge and resources to help accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. Lifebuoy’s latest partnership – with the Power of Nutrition – is a great example of how collaborations between business and NGOs can make tangible impact on people’s lives.”Martin Short, CEO at The Power of Nutrition, noted that, “Investing in hygiene and nutrition has the power to unlock huge social and economic changes, especially in countries with a high burden of stunting. Our partnership with Unilever and Lifebuoy unlocks committed public sector resources and enables us to multiply this funding, thereby maximizing the total investment in hygiene and nutrition.”The World Bank and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are the implementing partners of the Power of Nutrition, which was established to reduce stunting in children under five and address under-funding for nutrition.

"25 June 2019: The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has issued the first annual edition of the ‘SDG Pulse,’ an online statistical publication that reports on developments relating to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs based on analysis of several global indicators. The indicators include those related to SDGs 10, 16 and 17, which will be reviewed in depth during the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).TheSDG Pulsewas launched on 25 June 2019, during UNCTAD’s annual Trade Development Boardmeeting, convening in Geneva, Switzerland, from 25-28 June.Using a selected set of the official SDG indicators and complementary data and statistics, the online publication provides an update on the evolution of thematic issues related to the 2030 Agenda. The first edition considers multilateralism for trade and development, productive growth and structural transformation. It also discusses indicators related to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 10 (reduced inequalities), 12 (sustainable cities and communities), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).Current estimates of GDP in many developing countries are too low, thus overstating global economic inequality.For example, on Goal 16, the report reflects on SDG indicator 16.4.1 (Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows), which is currently categorized in ‘Tier 3’ of theglobal indicator framework, meaning that the methodology for its measurement has not been agreed. SDG Pulse states that UNCTAD and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which are the possible “custodian agencies” for this indicator, are working together on: an agreed statistical framework for the measurement of illicit financial flows (IFFs); a unified conceptualization of IFFs; and a first set of statistical measurement methodologies to be tested in developing countries, where the effects of IFFs on resources for development are most damaging. This work aims to provide the affected countries with detailed evidence to inform their policies to fight IFFs.The 2019 edition also discusses some measurement issues regarding inequality, which is the theme of the July 2019 session of the HLPF. The publication notes that this issue is complex, and that depending on the variable selected or the time horizon analyzed, global inequality may be said to be falling or rising. It also cautions against discussing economic inequality “in general,” as the quality of gross domestic product (GDP) estimates varies enormously, particularly in developing countries with large informal economies. It adds that current estimates of GDP in many developing countries are too low, thus overstating global economic inequality.SDG Pulse also highlights UNCTAD’stoolboxfor aligning technical cooperation with the SDGs. Per the publication, the toolbox features 28 technical cooperation projects, and in 2018, 249 projects were undertaken, accounting for USD43.7 million.

Gilbert Houngbo, UN-Water Chair and President, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), called for a transformational shift in how we value water and emphasized the need for data to inform decision making and integrated governance approaches.Under the patronage of the President of Hungary and former Member of the High-Level Panel on Water (HLPW), János Áder, the Government of Hungary hosted the Summit. BWS 2019 brought together approximately 2,500 participants from 118 countries, who came together in sessions addressing the: prevention of water crises; valuation of water versus the costs of a water crisis; economically rational behavior during a water crisis; mass migration; investment in water infrastructure; technology; science; implementation; transboundary water affairs; and institutional architecture. Side events and the ‘Digital and Nature-based Sustainable Solutions Expo’ took place in parallel to the Summit.The Summit’s key outcome document, titled ‘Budapest Appeal,’ identifies priority areas on water security and outlines concrete recommendations and solutions for governments to consider at relevant international fora, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 2021 World Water Forum, and the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The BWS 2019 Budapest Appeal recommends six areas to address with regard to implementation:Develop cooperation at all levels, through such actions as ensuring timely, transparent and accessible data and invoking the approach of “Nothing About Us Without Us”;Strengthen the role and capacity of institutions through,inter alia, ensuring gender balance and multi-stakeholder involvement, and rethinking the role of UN institutions in relation to water;Facilitate knowledge sharing at all levels on the science, management, impacts, and institutional arrangements for agreements on water;Build capacities through education, vocational training, and reviving local and indigenous traditional knowledge;Encourage a radical reorientation of financing flows by,inter alia, taking account of water-related risks in all investments and programmes, developing economic valuation approaches to deal with trade-offs and the “hidden” water- stranded assets, and targeting subsidies towards those most in need; andFrame every development policy with the environment in mind, taking into consideration the trade-offs, multiple interests and spillover effects with “life cycle” approaches.BWS 2019 took place from 15-17 October 2019, in Budapest, Hungary.

"The UK’s national statistical office is collaborating with city authorities and academics in the city of Bristol to provide data for monitoring the SDGs. Through a localized version of the ‘Open SDG’ platform, the project aims to help local authorities access data and report on the SDGs at the local level, and to provide insight into sub-national progress towards the SDGs in the UK.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has data for 78% of the SDG indicators, and reports progress through the Open SDG data platform, which is used by18 countries, cities, and regionsaround the world. However, sub-national governments face an ongoing challenge with producing and accessing local-level data.This project, announced by the University of Bristol on 30 July 2020, is piloting a city version of Open SDG to make local data “more accessible and meaningful” for local authorities and citizens in the UK. The project aims to “lower the bar for local authorities to engage with the SDGs.” As a result, it will be easier to identify disparities between localities, which can lead to better targeted approaches to achieve the SDGs.Bristol was the first UK city to produce a voluntary local review (VLR), which it presented to the UN in 2019. The University of Bristol produced the VLR in partnership with the City of Bristol’s ‘OneCity’ Office. [University of Bristol Press Release] [Open SDG platform]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
"On 4 November 2019, the US submitted to the UN a formal notification of its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change. The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification, on 4 November 2020.The notification was submitted pursuant to Paris Agreement Article 28, according to which a Party may withdraw from the Agreement by providing “written notification to the Depositary” at any point “after three years from the date on which [the] Agreement has entered into force for [that] Party.” “Any such withdrawal shall take effect upon expiry of one year from the date of receipt by the Depositary of the notification of withdrawal, or on such later date as may be specified in the notification of withdrawal.”The timing of the US’ withdrawal is significant as in 2020, countries are expected to update and enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement and to submit to the UNFCCC their long-term low-emission development strategies.According to a press statement by US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, US President Donald Trump “made thedecision to withdrawfrom the Paris Agreement” because US pledges made under the Agreement impose an “unfair economic burden” on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers. The statement notes that the US will continue to contribute to “international climate discussions” by offering “a realistic and pragmatic model” that shows that “innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy.” The US also pledges to “continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters.”A month prior to the US’ announcement, on 7 October 2019, the Russian Federation ratified the Paris Agreement. Upon ratification, the country made a declaration emphasizing that, as a non-Annex II country under the UNFCCC, it is not required to provide financial resources to enable developing countries’ climate action. Warning against creating “barriers to sustainable social and economic development,” the declaration further highlights “the importance of conservation and enhancement of absorbing capacity of forests and other ecosystems” and “the necessity of the maximum possible account of this capacity including in the implementation of the Agreement’s mechanisms.”The Paris Agreement was agreed in December 2015, and entered into force in November 2016. It aims to strengthen the global response to climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty by keeping global temperature rise this century “well below” 2°C above preindustrial levels and “pursuing efforts” to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.The number of countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement has reached 187. In addition to the Russian Federation, sinceNovember 2018, two more countries have joined the treaty: Oman (22 May 2019) and Suriname (13 February 2019).

"The World Bank has published a policy research working paper that estimates the share of jobs that can be performed from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper titled, ‘Who on Earth Can Work from Home?’ finds that the ability to telework is correlated with income.The July 2020 publication “presents new estimates of the share of jobs that can be done from home across the globe, assesses which workers are most at risk, and explores the impacts of COVID-19 on labor market inequality.” The authors’ analysis “is based on the task content of occupations, their information and communications technology requirements, and the availability of internet access by country and income groupings.”The paper finds that while globally, one of every five jobs can be performed from home, in low-income countries (LICs), only one of every 26 jobs is amenable to home-based work. Since better paid workers are more likely to be able to work from home, the authors argue, the pandemic “is likely to exacerbate inequality, especially in richer countries where better paid and educated workers are insulated from the shock.”However, the overall impact on labor market is expected to be more significant in poor countries, where very few can work from home, and “social protection systems are weaker.” The paper warns that around the world, young, poorly educated workers and workers on temporary contracts “are least likely to be able to work from home and more vulnerable to the labor market shocks from COVID-19.”The paper further notes that failure to account for internet access could lead to upward biased estimates of the resilience of LICs by a factor of 4, underestimating the vulnerability of poor countries.These findings suggest that the impacts of COVID-19 on labor market may compromise the achievement of the SDGs, in particular SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities).The paper was published by the World Bank’s Development Research Group, Development Economics.

"The second brief in the Brookings Institution’s ‘City Playbook for Advancing the SDGs’ series explores ways in which the city of Los Angeles, California, US, has leveraged partnerships with universities and their students to make “measurable and shareable progress on the SDGs.”Sanjeev Khagram, Occidental College, was the first university partner for the City. The brief highlights that he brought his professional network and expertise in building multi-sector partnerships. Additional university partners that have subsequently joined in LA’s efforts to implement the SDGs include the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of Southern California (USC), Arizona State University, and Pomona College.These colleges have engaged students in sustainable development fieldwork, courses, and projects focused on the SDGs. Student-led projects for clients in the Los Angeles City Hall have included research on global best practices to improve indoor air quality, creating a journey map for LA residents experiencing housing insecurity, and developing data sets and decision support tools for 21 of the 23 indicators in L.A.’s Biodiversity Index.The brief’s authors are Erin Bromaghim, Director of Olympic and Paralympic Development and Hilton Fellow on the SDGs, and Angela Kim, SDG Program and Data Manager, both in the Office of the Mayor of Los Angeles. They highlight that the partnerships began by identifying champions at each university. They note that to ensure the projects added value for all involved, it was important that the City clients were committed to keeping the projects on track, that projects were scoped appropriately for the amount of time available, and that expectations were shared regarding the skills, support, and level of interaction required of all parties to achieve the desired outcomes.The authors note that both the City and the universities benefited from the projects. The students and faculty gained an opportunity to conduct applied research and engage in service-based learning. The City gained capacity, expertise, and an outside perspective in response to the challenges the university teams addressed.

"The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre published a handbook to support local-level authorities in preparing reviews of SDG implementation (“voluntary local reviews,” or VLRs). The handbook provides examples from 14 reviews presented since 2018.Beginning in 2016, national governments have been invited to prepare Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of their national planning to implement the SDGs, as part of the global follow-up and review mechanism for the 2030 Agenda. The VNRs are presented during the UN’s annual sessions of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). In 2018,municipalities began preparingtheir own SDG implementation plans and reports, termed VLRs.The ‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’releasedin early 2020, provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation. The indicators can help local-level authorities establish baselines for their communities, compare action with that of other cities, and monitor their progress on addressed specific challenges.The scope of each VLR varies. For example:Helsinki, Finland’s VLR is structured around five goals using a limited number of local indicators with an in-depth analysis of the different challenges;Bristol, UK’s VLR is based on the UN’s guidelines for VNRs, and reviews each of the 17 Goals;Kitakyushu and Shimokawa, Japan also review each of the 17 Goals;New York City, US has focused annual VLRs on the selected SDGs under review by the HLPF each year; andLa Paz, Bolivia includes includes maps of the indicators per city district.The report suggests the following steps be taken to localize the SDGs in a particular community:define the management method;conduct a mapping exercise of the SDGs versus the existing city strategic plan development;define the number and type of Goals the city wants to assess and monitor;diagnosis the state of the SDGs in the community through the preparation of a VLR;conduct co-creation sessions with stakeholders and communities;define an agenda and targets, redefine monitoring indicators, and adapt management mechanisms;conduct pilot projects;monitor the projects; andevaluate the projects and redefine priority actions.The JRC intends to test the data and methods presented the Handbook with selected cities, and will update and improve the methodology for local SDG monitoring.The JRC is the science and knowledge service of the European Commission.

"28 August 2019: The NDC Partnership has published a brief detailing its experience with and benefits of multi-stakeholder engagement in climate action and lessons learned. It explains that such engagement ensures that a range of stakeholder priorities are reflected in Partnership Plans, so that all stakeholders benefit from climate action and feel ownership and responsibility to implement mitigation and adaptation measures.The brief titled, ‘NDC Partnership Experience with Multi-Stakeholder Engagement: Key Lessons Learned,’ highlights lessons from the NDC Partnership’s country work, challenges to multi-stakeholder engagement and suggested solutions, and is intended as a tool for a range of stakeholders working on climate action. Highlighting difficulties related to communication and coordination among national and international stakeholders, the brief describes the NDC Partnership’s role in bringing together national stakeholders and international institutions around planning, financing and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).More specifically, the brief summarizes key takeaways from the Partnership’s multi-stakeholder consultation process, and focuses on engagement with representatives across government and society, ministries of finance and planning, and international institutions that provide financial and technical assistance.Some of the lessons learned relate to coordinating within national governments at the local or international levels, and focus on the need for: inclusion of all stakeholders; strong leadership; and building off existing processes and coordination groups rather than creating new ones.Stakeholder engagement increases alignment between the climate agenda, national development agendas, and the SDGs.The publication describes multiple benefits of stakeholder engagement. Multi-stakeholder engagement, the brief points out, helps consolidate available finance by embedding climate action in domestic budgets, as well as increasing access to domestic, international and private finance. It also increases alignment between the climate agenda, national development agendas, and the SDGs.The publication also discusses the need for different actors to take ownership of various aspects of climate policy such as for municipal authorities to prioritize infrastructure projects, for finance ministries to allocate funding towards climate-smart projects, for international donors to provide technical and financial support, and for civil society to support political efforts.The brief draws from experiences in more than 40 countries, and various consultations, which aimed to: increase engagement across ministries, sectors and civil society; strengthen participation of ministries of finance and planning; and involve implementing and development partners throughout the process.The brief warns that challenges to sustaining stakeholder engagement and buy-in remain. For example, government and personnel changes can delay NDC Partnership planning activities. In this instance, embedding climate action into medium- and long-term national and sectoral plans can help stave off disruptions from changing government administrations.Additional challenges include: conflicting planning/budgeting cycles and NDC processes can lead to missed opportunities; lack of sectoral engagement or inter-sectoral coordination can hinder effective planning and implementation; engaging the private sector requires clear investment returns or policy signals; securing participation from ministers and Heads of State requires additional effort; and multi-stakeholder consultations require personnel and funding to organize, which many countries lack.The NDC Partnership is a coalition of more than 140 countries, institutions, and non-state actors, and supports governments’ NDC implementation.

"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) has published a report tracking progress made on SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) at the regional and country levels through the indicators of energy access, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The report also addresses interlinkages between progress in SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report,’ seeks to help build capacity in the Arab region through access to information, with the aim of strengthening policies to improve energy security, enhance climate resilience and mainstream the SDGs into regional and national policy processes.According to the report, SDG target 7.1 (by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) has seen progress, and the Arab region is on track to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 (SDG indicator 7.1.1) and improved access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2). The region’s electrification rate rose from 88.4% in 2010 to 92.5% in 2017, making it the most electrified region in the developing world. By 2017, electrification access was almost universal in all but three Arab countries (Mauritania, the Sudan and Yemen), and the number of people without access fell from 40 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2017, although increasing conflicts in the region have impacted on energy access in affected areas.The share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the Arab region’s total energy consumption since 2010.However, the report warns, progress on other SDG targets is not on track. Regarding SDG target 7.2 (increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030), the share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the region’s total energy consumption since 2010, with Arab least developed countries (LDCs) accounting for a large proportion of renewable energy use through traditional biomass. Increased solar energy deployment has contributed little to the total primary energy supply in most non-LDCs. Regarding SDG 7.3 (doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030), energy intensity in the region has continued to decline, but not enough to align with the need to decouple economic growth and energy consumption.The report explains that to achieve both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, Arab countries must:equip local markets with effective policy frameworks, including incentives, such as availability of finance, investments in sustainable and clean energy, education infrastructure and services, and the removal of market barriers;ensure inclusive, transparent and competent state-level institutions to guarantee sustainable energy policies;update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that include renewable energy and energy efficiency goals;strengthen regional cooperation; andpromote an energy transition that fosters more inclusive and sustainable societies.The report also urges better use of development aid to support scalable, replicable projects that benefit local communities. [Publication:Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report] [Publication Overview] [Publication Highlights] [Publication Landing Page]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"27 September 2019: The Governments of Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu launched a partnership to make shipping in the Pacific Ocean zero carbon by 2050. The governments announced the partnership at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, and highlighted the partnership at the ‘Securing our Future in the Blue Pacific’ event.According to the Ocean Action Hub, Pacific island populations depend on shipping for their connection to the outside world. They use ships to travel and to access medicines and other imported goods. Pacific countries are “precariously dependent on imported fossil fuels and acutely vulnerable to price shocks or supply disruptions,” and the region imports 95% of its fuel. In addition, Pacific countries spend an average of 40% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on imported petroleum.In recognition of these challenges, the Governments of Fiji and the Marshall Islands prepared a joint government briefing paper. The paper found that, to date, “investment in the sustainable development of sea transport for Pacific island countries has been extremely limited.” The paper suggested a transition to a “sustainable, resilient and decarbonized sea transport at this scale will require substantial investment,” including at least USD 500 million to implement a ten-year work programme.The Marshall Islands Environment Minister, David Paul, told participants at the ‘Securing our Future in the Blue Pacific’ event that securing funding for the Pacific Blue Partnership would help catalyze a “rapid transformation of our … shipping sector.” The Partnership aims to reduce Pacific countries’ carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from shipping by 40% by 2030, with the aim of achieving complete decarbonization by 2050. To achieve this goal, the Partnership is seeking USD 500 million to retrofit existing cargo and passenger ferries with low-carbon technologies and to buy zero-emission vessels.

"10 October 2019: Mortality rates published by the World Health Organization (WHO) show that 121 countries have achieved SDG target 3.2 on reducing deaths of infants and children under five. However, at least 53 other countries must accelerate progress if they are to reach this target by 2030. WHO also reports that 38 countries have instituted suicide prevention programmes, but many more must take action to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (SDG target 3.4).According to the WHO, many countries already have sufficient financing to achieve the SDG targets on maternal and child mortality, if they “spend it on the right things.” WHO and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF)launcheda joint appeal on 19 September for governments to direct sufficient funding toward achieving primary health targets. The agencies estimate that around USD200 billion will be needed to do this, and that many developing countries can make important gains in maternal and child health through affordable solutions such as ensuring adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), helping adolescent girls to complete their school education, providing sufficient nutrition for pregnant women, and providing access to basic medicines and vaccines.Reporting on infant and maternal mortality, UNICEF highlights persistent inequalities: babies born in sub-Saharan Africa are ten times more likely to die than babies born in wealthy countries, and that South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa account for eight out of ten maternal and child deaths worldwide. SDG target 3.1 aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 live births, while SDG target 3.2 commits to reducing deaths of infants to at least 12 per 1,000 live births, and to reduce deaths of children under five to 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030.Reducing global suicide rates to 10% by 2020 is a milestone towards SDG target 3.4. On 10 September, World Suicide Prevention Day, WHOlauncheda one-month global “40 seconds of action” campaign to raise awareness of suicide rates and how suicide can be prevented. WHO reports that globally, one person dies from suicide every 40 seconds. WHO Executive Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on all countries to incorporate suicide prevention strategies into their national health and education programs.Suicide is reported by WHO to be the second leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29 years, outstripped only by traffic accidents. Pesticide poisoning accounts for 20% of suicides, and regulation of highly toxic pesticides has lowered suicide rates in some countries. Other approaches to suicide prevention include training of health workers to better assess and manage suicidal behavior, early treatment of mental health disorders, and monitoring of alcohol and substance use.World Mental Health Day on 10 October also focused on suicide prevention. WHO, the International Association for Suicide Prevention, and United for Global Mental Healthlaunched information resourcesabout actions that emergency workers, health workers, teachers and employers can take to help prevent suicide.",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Third Local and Regional Governments Forum on the 2030 Agenda took place virtually on the sidelines of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).The event focused on the theme ‘The Decade of Action – bolstering change from the ground-up.’ It also  highlighted actions that local and regional governments have taken in preventing and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Speakers emphasized the importance of multilevel governance, sound local finances, decentralized cooperation, and territorial cohesion in the post-COVID-19 era.Mahmoud Mohieldin, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, highlighted the need for a new ‘DNA’ for cities – data, networks, and artificial intelligence – for a more rapid recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and effective delivery of essential services.The event included three panel discussions. The first addressed delivering universal basic services. Panelists underscored the need for integrating the environment-related SDGs into local and regional governments’ COVID-19 recovery plans and efforts, and for subsidiarity and citizens’ participation in decision making to ensure SDG implementation in the post-COVID-19 era.A second panel discussed multilevel territorial governance and sustainable financing. Haoliang Xu, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, underscored the need for voluntary local reviews to include sustainable management of natural resources. Panelists also said cities need new, green, sustainable development agendas moving forward, urged government expenditure at the subnational level, and underscored the need for accessibility to be considered a crosscutting issue in COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.The third panel focused on building back better in the post-COVID recovery. Wim Dries, Mayor of Genk, Belgium, said if the SDGs had already been achieved, the global health crisis and its social and economic impacts would have been far less severe. Panelists underscored the need for new forms of distribution, participation, and parity in political representation in the post-COVID-19 era to build more just, inclusive, and resilient societies. They said the pandemic necessitated replicating and scaling up best practices.During the closing session, speakers called for,inter alia, local and regional governments to serve as advocates for theUN Secretary-General’s proposed six climate-related actions to shape the COVID-19 recovery; international institutions and development banks to provide credit lines for countries that are epicenters of the pandemic; and a more inclusive multilateral system to advance post-COVID-19 recovery efforts and the 2030 Agenda.The Forum was organized by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), UN Development Programme (UNDP), and Local 2030. The Forum convened on 13 July 2020 in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"August 2019: In June 2019, the people of Navakavu (Fiji) met to celebrate the first year of implementation of the Navakavu Revitalisation Strategy 2018-2022 (NRS), a local development strategy aligned to the SDGs and the Government of Fiji’s Development Plan 2017-2021. The NRS, a first for the Vanua o Navakavu (Vanua), demonstrates,inter alia, the adaptation of national and international development goals to the local context.Present at the NRS launch last year, the Prime Minister of Fiji hon Josaia v Bainimarama assured his government’s support for the Strategy, which revolves around the five main goals of job creation (SDG 1), housing development (SDG 11), quality health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4), sustainable land use (SDG 15), and infrastructure development (SDG 9). These five Strategic Goals are also meant to support the Vanua’s commitment to good governance (SDG 16), climate change prevention (SDG 13), support for youth and gender parity (SDG 10), and meaningful partnerships (SDG 17). The first session of the Navakavu Strategic meeting focused on the theme of ‘leaving no one behind.’On marine protected areas (SDG 14), the Goneturaga Na Rokobaleni and his council approved the commencement for the gazetting of the Navakavu Marine Protected Area (NMPA) to platform its long-term plan of a living marine science laboratory. The goal is boost conservation, education and tourism through an integrated initiative. The NMPA is a joint initiative led by the Vanua with the close support and assistance of the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (FLMMA). In March 2019, more than 60 students from the University of the South Pacific (uSp) came to conduct research on NMPA and on agricultural resources.On youth, the Minister for Youth and Sports, hon Laisenia B Tuitubou, was the chief guest with the Navakavu youth in commemorating World Oceans Day. The paramount chief and his council joined the youth to replant mangroves, trees and to clean garbage from the shoreline.On health, the NRS supports both screening and awareness. Work is continuing with the Ministry of Health towards tri-monthly screenings, followed by awareness building sessions during alternate months. The Strategy’s second round of screenings focused on cervical cancer for Navakavu women, and thus had a gender component. Also under the NRS umbrella, on 7 June 2019, a commitment letter was signed to build the Sir James Michael ah Koy Health Centre in Navakavu.The NRS intends to model how local ambitions can serve both national and international development objectives.

"The Alliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) have published a background paper on managing the water-related impacts of climate change. It argues that water is key to effective climate change adaptation.The 42-page report titled, ‘Adaptation’s Thirst: Accelerating the Convergence of Water and Climate Action,’ outlines the anticipated impacts of climate change on water,  including floods, drought, tropical storms, decline in water quantity and quality, and changes to fundamental hydrology. The authors call for climate-resilient water management to be ‘the common ground and a unifying agenda’ for adaptation.They provide six detailed recommendations, namely:system-wide action rather than fragmented, infrastructure-focused decision making – for example, multi-level governance and self-organization at lower levels of administration is encouraged;preparations for greater uncertainty in climate conditions, including greater variability in water resources;investments in adaptation, taking full account of likely future water risks;investments in water and climate information systems;aligning water finance with climate finance; andusing water as an enabler of adaptation, ensuring policy coherence.The publication maps out high-level actions that should be taken by water and climate policy and management communities. Its ‘Action Framework on Climate-Resilient Water Management’ cites promising examples from many countries in terms of governance and participation; information and learning; diversity and connectivity; and infrastructure, technology and water management options.The background paper was commissioned by the Global Commission on Adaptation, which seeks to promote concrete solutions to adaptation needs.

"Colombia has adopted a law limiting the use of lead paint, particularly in items used by children. The law cites “the right of persons to develop physically and intellectually in a lead-free environment.”The Lead in Paint Billadoptedon 27 July 2020 prohibits the use, manufacture, import, or marketing of articles that contain lead exceeding 99 ppm (0.009%), especially in elements of direct or frequent contact by children. It also calls for blood tests in children to determine their level of lead exposure, sets out national responsibilities for treating exposure cases.We are responding to a young country that wants to see a more positive evolution in the protection of the environment.According to apress releasefrom the Colombian legislature, President Iván Duque highlighted the importance of the law for protecting children in the country, as well as protecting the environment. He said, “We are responding to a young country that wants to see a more positive evolution in the protection of the environment.”Senator Nadia Blel said the law ensures that “children will be able to live without fear that their toys, colors, the paintings in their houses will become a threat to their health.”Led by Colombia’s Ministry of the Environment, the government will have one year to develop environmental monitoring protocols for industries that include lead and its compounds in their processes.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) have published an overview of analytical methods for measuring lead in paint both in the laboratory and in situ where lead paint has been used.TheBrief guide to analytical methods for measuring leadin paint seeks to inform public health officials, scientific institutions and policymakers who are not laboratory specialists but who may need to develop plans for measuring lead concentrations in new paint and for studies on lead paint availability on the market.Lead paint is an important source of exposure to lead, particularly for children and workers. It is preventable as paints with similar colors and properties can be manufactured without using lead additives. However, even with restrictions on use of lead in paint, a legacy of lead paint in buildings and structures might continue to be a source of exposure for many years.The document details: well-established analytical methods for measuring lead content of paint that vary in terms of cost and complexity; strengths and limitations of these methods; and considerations when deciding whether to use a laboratory-based method or portable technology, and whether to establish a laboratory service for measuring lead or to use services from another laboratory.The document identifies two reasons for measuring the lead content in paint, namely: assessing new paints to check for compliance with regulatory or legal restrictions, or to help determine whether lead paints are being sold; or to find out whether existing paint on surfaces in homes, or on furniture, playground equipment, or toys, contains lead to assess the need for risk management measures.Specific methods to measure lead in paint include laboratory methods, benchtop or portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) devices, and test kits. While chemical test kits are available, the brief explains they cannot measure the lead content of paint with the same accuracy as laboratory and XRF measurements.Methodology choice, according to the document, depends on, inter alia: reason for analysis (compliance, risk assessment or screening); number of samples to be tested; substrate to be tested (new paint, existing painted surface, surface size and shape); cost limitations; need for precise measurement; quantification limit required; and availability of trained personnel and analytical equipment.The brief recommends using a laboratory certified by a recognized body and accredited to carry the required tests. It also suggests considering, when choosing a laboratory: experience in testing paints; analytical methods used and limit of detection; capacity to handle the number of samples required; analyses costs, including shipping; and turnaround time.The document explains that establishing a laboratory service requires significant investment of resources. It also underscores the need to prevent external contamination, and ensure quality assurance and control in laboratory practices. It identifies standards, certification and accreditation as important measures for ensuring and demonstrating laboratory quality.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Scholars from the Harvard Business School released a working paper that illustrates how sustainability issues can become financially important for corporations and investors. The paper demonstrates that financial materiality is not a “state of being” but a “process of becoming,” based on the issues’ social context.The authors of ‘Pathways to Materiality: How Sustainability Issues Become Financially Material to Corporations and Their Investors’ identify five stages for the pathway to materiality: the status quo, catalyst events, stakeholder reaction, company reaction, and regulatory reaction and innovation. In a status quo stage, there is typically misalignment between the interests of business and society, and businesses may take actions that negatively affect society, such as through producing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that promote climate change.On the other hand, stakeholder reaction to an issue can result in companies taking action, such as when public attention focused on the environmental impacts of plastic straws. The paper explains that the dissemination of statistics about plastic straws and marine plastic pollution led to support for campaigns to ban plastic straws, as a “symbol of the wider push to reduce consumption of all single-use plastics.”The authors suggest that the five stages can be used to predict when sustainability issues are more likely to become financially material. In particular, they argue that sustainability issues become financial material when:Stakeholders receive actionable information about alignment between societal and business interests;Media and NGOs have more power and politicians respond to this power; andCompanies have a higher capacity for innovation.Companies and investors can use this framework to allocated resources based on expectations about future materiality; the authors suggest that ultimately, materiality depends on current corporate behavior being misaligned with emerging social needs.Jean Rogers and George Serafeim published the document as a Harvard Business School Accounting & Management Unit Working Paper.

"The EU is developing a strategy to reduce the risks associated with producing and using chemicals, as part of the European Green Deal framework. The strategy is intended to simplify and strengthen existing EU rules on chemicals. It is expected to be adopted in the third quarter of 2020.The Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability will also review ways for EU agencies and scientific bodies to work together and streamline substance reviews through a single agency, in a process termed, “one substance – one assessment.” It is aimed at encouraging innovation for the development of safe and sustainable alternatives, as well as facilitating the safe trade of chemicals within the EU.A road map for the Strategy calls for strengthening and simplifying the chemicals regulatory framework to increase the level of protection of human health and environment, particularly from exposure to endocrine disruptors, hazardous chemicals in products including in imports, and very persistent chemicals. The road map notes that those developing and using safer and more sustainable chemicals are struggling to be competitive. The strategy will support other EC priorities related to,inter alia: strengthening EU competitiveness and i ts industrial and strategic autonomy; ensuring the manufacture and supply of safe and affordable medicines; developing markets for innovative companies; and ensuring strict enforcement of EU legislation.The strategy will build on an evidence base gathered during recent policy evaluations and chemicals-related initiatives. It will also draw on past and ongoing evaluations of related legislation, particularly in the areas of environment, products, workers’ protection, and food.Consultations on the road map held in May and June 2020 targeted stakeholders, experts, and the public, to gather input on challenges on the way forward for EU chemicals policy. Thefeedbackaddressed,inter alia, fitness of chemicals legislation and options to address the nexus between chemical, product, and waste legislation.The European Environmental Bureau (EEB), a network of environmental citizens’ organizations, published aposition paperdetailing its priorities for the  Strategy. The paper highlights that exposure to toxic chemicals increases vulnerability to pandemics such as COVID-19. The authors note priorities including: ensuring transparency on substances in products along the life cycle; ending toxic recycling and promoting a cleaner circular economy; accelerating EU plans for substitution, innovation for safe alternatives, and green chemistry; filling funding gaps through the polluter pays principle; and ensuring EU global leadership for a toxic-free environment.

"Despite having “60% of the world’s unused land,” the African continent is the “hungriest,” spendingover US$35 billion annually in food imports. In tandem with the African Union’s designation of 2018 as the ‘Anti-Corruption Year,’ the 2019 Conference on Land Policy in Africa (CLPA) convened under the theme, ‘Winning the Fight Against Corruption in the Land Sector: Sustainable Pathways for Africa’s Transformation,’ and explored how to harness Africa’s vast resources to achieve food security and inclusive development.Held from 25-29 November 2019 in Abidjan, Côte D’Ivoire, the conference aimed to deepen capacity among African land stakeholders through improved access to knowledge and information on land policy development and implementation. Discussions explored, among other issues, how to deploy more financial and human resources, andharness technological advancesin agriculture, as well as in geospatial sciences and other relevant land sectors, to counter corruption in the land sector, “especially in rural areas and among the most vulnerable.”While noting the importance of securing land rights for all citizens, as provided for in the 2009 Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa, various speakers cautioned that efforts to improve land tenure security by providing land titles to all must be linked to exploringinnovative solutionsto promote land consolidation and optimization to address the growing problem of sub-division of family and communal land into economically unproductive units.Diverse stakeholders, including traditional leaders, civil society representatives, and academic institutions, made commitments to explore concrete solutions to such challenges, including through the review of cultural practices and beliefs that prevent women’s access to land. Traditional leaders further highlighted the need to fight corruption within the ranks of their traditional institutions, including through closer collaboration with government and land administration institutions.In their call for action, civil society organizations pledged to continue to serve as watchdogs, enhancing transparency and accountability by profiling corruption cases and documenting their impacts.The third edition of the biennial conference, CLPA 2019 was organized by the Land Policy Centre, a joint initiative of the African Union Commission (AUC), the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB).

"The UN Environment Programme (UNEP), alongside several partners in the Sustainable Infrastructure Partnership (SIP), developed a set of ten principles for post-COVID-19 recovery focusing on investing in sustainable and resilient infrastructure. The ‘Principles for Recovery’ provide a framework for decision making on infrastructure spending for post-COVID-19 recovery and stimulus packages.The Principles call for decisions on infrastructure spending for post-COVID-19 recovery to start with strategic planning that is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Such planning, the Principles note, should consider systemic linkages between sectors and across space and time. To avoid future crises, the Principles recommend that infrastructure ensure resilience through integrated, systems-level planning and built-in flexibility and redundancy.In order to revive employment in the aftermath of the global pandemic, the Principles suggest that infrastructure investments support all levels of enterprise, including the informal sector, through collaboration with subnational institutions. They further call for balancing economic considerations with investments in social infrastructure to promote health, well-being, and gender equality, which, in turn, should bring wider benefits to communities.The Principles state that prioritizing natural infrastructure will help reduce emissions, deliver essential services such as water and sanitation, protect people and assets from hazards, and support renewed increases in economic activity. According to the Principles, post-COVID-19 infrastructure investments, including those in digital infrastructure, should facilitate new sustainable lifestyles, patterns of mobility, and modes of operation in both urban and rural areas.Noting that new infrastructure assets and development sites may not be necessary where existing infrastructure can be rehabilitated and retrofitted, the Principles warn against physical constructions compromising ecosystems and biodiversity, eroding human rights, or destabilizing politically fragile contexts.On supply chain disruption risks, the Principles recommend that infrastructure systems use sustainable technologies and local, green materials to enhance resource efficiency, create local jobs, and provide “culturally appropriate” solutions.Finally, in striving for a quick economic turnaround, the Principles caution against infrastructure decisions bypassing consultation and transparency processes, undermining environmental safeguards, or generating unsustainable debt.

"A report on how the technology community can strengthen gender data has been released by the ‘Project17’ initiative. Facebook launched the initiative in partnership with Data2X, Girl Effect, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, and Ladysmith to identify areas where tech companies can strengthen the gender data ecosystem.The report titled. ‘Building alliances for gender equality: How the tech community can strengthen the gender data ecosystem’, focuses on gender data gaps related to the following areas: climate change and migration; family life; last-mile healthcare; hidden economies; gender-based violence and discrimination online; science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and schools; and shifting social norms.The report finds a lack of communication between organizations working on gender equality and technology companies. The report calls on tech companies to leverage their resources and data to help answer critical gender and sustainable development questions.Facebook notes plans to continue to employ its dataset to bridge gender data gaps and drive progress on gender equality. The organization’s ‘Data for Good’ work features Displacement and Disaster maps that help humanitarian response agencies determine community-specific needs during a crisis by providing them with real-time data on population movement. Partners with access to these maps can then understand the proportion of displaced women and men, where women are relocating, and when women are able to return home. Facebook intends to collaborate with the World Bank Group and EqualMeasures2030 to conduct a global survey on gender equality.Facebook’s actions are part of a growing moment among the private sector to leverage their networks, resources and skills to support sustainable development.

"18 September 2019: The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) has created a searchable database of tools and methods for including ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) in planning and decision making. EbA is relevant to achieving many of the SDGs, including those on food security (SDG 2), water and sanitation (SDG 6) climate action (SDG 13), oceans (SDG 14) and terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15).IIED, which seeks to make existing tools more accessible to practitioners and policy makers and promote the uptake of nature-based solutions, worked with the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to create theEbA Tools Navigator.TheEbA Tools Navigatorcatalogs 246 different tools in a macro-enabled Excel database that provides brief descriptions of the tools, their target users, the primary ecosystem they are designed for, their language availability, and other features. The database lists seven stages of EbA: planning; assessment; design; valuation; implementation; monitoring and evaluation; and mainstreaming. Tools listed are identified by the EbA stage they are meant for.Other useful information in the navigator includes the time needed for application of each tool, and what training or skills are required to use it. For example, the InVEST tool developed by Stanford University for Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs requires basic to intermediate GIS skills, is intended for use in assessment and valuation, and requires two to three weeks to learn.The International Climate Initiative (IKI) funded the development of the project.

The organizers – the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), known collectively as the Geneva Trade Hub agencies – launched a joint website to provide comprehensive information regarding progress on trade-related SDG targets.Yonov Frederick Agah, WTO, highlighted areporton the role of trade in SDG implementation. Agah said WTO reform can contribute to achieving sustainable development by advancing WTO negotiations, particularly on fisheries subsidies, as they impact social and environmental policies.Isabelle Durant, UNCTAD, underscored the need to: adopt better regulations and policies; strengthen multilateralism; reinforce dispute settlement mechanisms; and address climate change impacts on trade. Marion Jansen, ITC, said small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can have a positive impact on approximately 60% of the SDG targets.Mauricio Trujillo, UN Major Group for Children and Youth, stressed the need to implement economic reforms to achieve the SDGs, including by changing how we evaluate economic growth. He recommended considering equity and human rights in trade regulations, and the effects of digitalization in trade rules.Participants also: recalled the ways in which some countries, such as China, have benefited from free trade to achieve middle-income status; highlighted the Geneva Trade Hub agencies’ collaboration and investment in, for example, trade-related indicators; and agreed that strengthening multilateral systems to continue supporting the SDGs and to combat poverty, in particular, is critical.The HLPF convened in New York, US, from 9-18 July 2019.

"An analysis by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has found pervasive bias—by both men and women—against women worldwide. The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) examines how social beliefs can obstruct gender equality across four dimensions: politics, education, economics/work, and physical integrity.The GSNI was launched in a publication titled, ‘Tackling Social Norms: A game changer for gender inequalities.’ To cover the four dimensions of gender equality, the Index features survey data on seven indicators from 75 countries, and covers more than 80% of the world’s population.Countries with higher social norms biases tend to have higher levels of gender inequality.The Index reveals that nearly 90% of the world’s population—91% of men and 86% of women—hold some kind of bias against women. For example, approximately half of the population feels that men make better political leaders. This is reflected in parliaments worldwide, despite similar voting rates among men and women: only 24% of parliamentary seats worldwide are held by women, and only ten of 193 Member States have female heads of government.More than a quarter of people (28%) think it is justified for a man to beat his wife, according to the data. However, the Index and recent events show that sentiments are changing. Raquel Lagunas, UNDP Gender Team, notes that women’s rights demonstrations across the world and the #MeToo movement have signaled that new norms and alternatives are needed, and people are energized to campaign for gender equality.The GSNI uses data from multiple “waves” of the World Values Survey from 2005 to 2014. It follows two methods of aggregation: a “union approach” that measures the percentage of people with any bias across the seven indicators, and an “intersection approach” that measures the percentage of people with at least two biases across the indicators.The data reveal shifts in countries’ shifts in bias over time. Progress in the share of men with no gender social norms bias, for example, was largest in Chile, Australia, the US, and the Netherlands. The data also show a negative change in the share of women with no gender social norms bias—indicating increasing bias in many countries, with Sweden and India representing the highest setbacks. On the whole, the GSNI finds that countries with higher social norms biases tend to have higher levels of gender inequality. Statistical tables containing data from the GSNI are available in a set of annexes to the report.With 2020 marking the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (Beijing+25) on women’s empowerment and gender equality, UNDP calls on world leaders to accelerate action to meet global gender goals.

"The World Health Assembly (WHA) agreed on a roadmap to tackle 20 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and disease groups that affect hundreds of millions of people. The roadmap aims to improve coordination and collaboration among health partners, integrate and mainstream approaches, and promote greater ownership by governments and communities.The roadmap was agreed during the 73rd meeting of the WHA, which convened from 9-14 November 2020. The WHA is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) and meets annually.The new roadmap features targets that align with the SDGs.The 2021-2030 roadmap replaces the first roadmap, which was published in 2012. Although the WHO said “significant progress” has been made towards the targets in the earlier roadmap, those targets will not be achieved.The new roadmap, titled ‘Ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals: a roadmap for neglected tropical diseases 2021-2030,’ sets global targets and milestones to prevent, control, eliminate, and eradicate the selected diseases and disease groups. The roadmap features cross-cutting targets aligned with the SDGs. The targets include:a 90% reduction in the number of people requiring treatment for neglected tropical diseases;elimination of at least one NTD in 100 countries;a 75% reduction in the disability-adjusted life years related to NTDs; anderadicating two diseases: dracunculiasis, commonly known as Guinea-worm disease; and yaws, a chronic skin disease that primarily affects children under 15 years of age.The WHO has warned that emerging drug resistance could threaten decades of advances in addressing neglected tropical diseases. The WHO recommends continuing to monitor drug efficacy and called for developing “an appropriate arsenal of second-line drugs” to ensure continued protections against neglected tropical diseases. The WHO plans to increase awareness and understanding of global antimicrobial resistance during the annual World Antimicrobial Awareness Week from 18-24 November.Mwelecele Ntuli Malecela, WHO, said the 2021-2030 roadmap addresses critical gaps across multiple diseases and “integrates and mainstreams approaches within national health systems and coordinates action across sectors.” Malecela added that the roadmap provides opportunities to evaluate and adjust programmatic actions as needed.In SDG target 3.3, governments commit to, by 2030, ending the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, and combatting hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases.

"The Satoyama Initiative aims to protect the planet, build resilience, advance well-being, share nature’s benefits, and foster partnerships. Participants during a virtual event focused on the Initiative sought to break down how these objectives could help to drive a green post-COVID-19 recovery.During the event, which focused on the theme ‘Satoyama Initiative – Societies in Harmony with Nature: An inclusive approach for communities, landscapes and seascapes’ and took place on the sidelines of HLPF 2020, speakers discussed the role of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including through integrated landscape and seascape approaches. Participants explored lessons learned through integrating the management of socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS) into national and sub-national policies as a critical contribution to the SDGs and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.Opening the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, described the Satoyama Initiative as a crucial pathway to expand partnerships with indigenous peoples and local communities.Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Minister of Environment and Energy, Costa Rica, and incoming GEF CEO, spoke to the Initiative’s philosophical principles and redefinition of the relationship between humans and nature. He suggested developing these principles as a “vaccine” to overcome the threats posed by COVID-19.Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Executive Secretary, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), expressed hope that lessons learned from the Initiative’s community development and sustainable use of biodiversity will contribute to the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and achieving the SDGs.Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, Japan, outlined ways to redesign socio-economic systems to recover from COVID-19 through decarbonization, circular economies, and decentralization.The Initiative is based on the concept of ‘Satoyama,’ a traditional rural landscape in Japan. TheInternational Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI)was established in 2010 to implement the Initiative. It currently consists of 267 members, including governments, non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and private sector entities. The Initiative’s Community Development and Knowledge Management for the Satoyama Initiative (COMDEKS) has supported over total 400 community-based projects in selected landscapes and seascapes in 20 developing countries through the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP).The event was organized by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Ministry of the Environment of Japan, Ministry of Environment and Energy of Costa Rica, CBD Secretariat, UNDP – GEF SGP, and UN University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS). Over 260 participants attended the 16 July event, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [ENB Coverage of the Side Event] [HLPF 2019 Side Event on the Satoyama Initiative]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
"The British Columbia Council for International Cooperation (BCCIC) has released a report on mechanisms for accelerating SDG implementation. The publication aims to inform discussions during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and provides recommendations to government authorities in Canada.The report titled, ‘Reading Between the Lines: Accelerated Implementation for Agenda 2030,’ was released on 9 June 2020. The 2020 edition of the yearly report includes a chapter on Canada’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the 2030 Agenda. The report also reflects on Canada’s progress on interlinkages within the 2030 Agenda, describing how policymakers and practitioners have utilized interlinkages in various sectors. The authors call to “look between the Goals” for interactions and fulcrums of change.More than half the Goals related directly to provincial jurisdiction, making it urgent to coordinate the SDGs sub-nationally.Unlike the previous yearly reports from BCCIC, which functioned as a scorecard for Canada’s performance on the SDGs, the 2020 edition examines underlying principles of Canada’s SDG performance, said Zosa Gruber, BCCIC.The report’s key recommendations include:Identify SDG indicator data needs and sources across the country;Map organizations across sectors working on the SDGs in Canada’s 2030 strategy, and formalize a multi-stakeholder body with a specific mechanism of accountability to the federal government;Create a mechanism for working collaboratively with the provinces, territories, and municipalities to implement the 2030 Agenda to ensure policy coherence; “more than half of the goals relate directly to Provincial/Territorial jurisdiction” making it urgent for the federal government to coordinate SDG implementation sub-nationally;Include spillover analysis in Canada’s voluntary national review (VNR) and follow-up and review processes to accurately reflect whether meeting one target is detracting from the achievement of another target elsewhere;Mandate consistent data reporting for spillover analysis, and work with the territories, provinces, and federal ministries to conduct a spillover analysis of Canada’s largest resource industries (oil and gas, fisheries, forestry and mining), which have the greatest spillover impacts within Canada and abroad;Translate the “leave no one behind” actions proposed in Canada’s interim SDG strategy into concrete commitments, actions, partnerships, and initiatives;Promote human rights-based analysis (HRBA) tools to identify and prioritize those “furthest behind”;Refine the Canadian Indicator Framework by adding transformative change indicators, indicators that speak to SDG interlinkages, and indicators/ targets that speak to the needs of those furthest behind;Ensure that those at risk of being left behind play an active role in sub-national, national, and VNR reporting on 2030 Agenda progress and participate in Canadian delegations at the HLPF;Ensure that COVID-19 recovery proceeds through an SDG-sensitive process that locks into place the gains made during the crisis (e.g., on reducing carbon and unsustainable consumption and production); andContinue to take a leadership role in protecting health, environmental, and food systems weakened by COVID-19.The BCCIC report was produced with the support of Global Affairs Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada.

"Because the atmosphere knows no borders, climate change is a problem of the global commons. But assigning responsibility for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over time and across countries has proven difficult, and the history of international climate change policy has revolved around this central question. This is the dilemma explored in the latest policy brief from IISD’s ‘Still Only One Earth’ series.The policy brief titled, ‘Global Climate Change Governance: The search for effectiveness and universality,’ by Mari Luomi, outlines two challenging themes in global climate change governance: how to differentiate between countries’ responsibilities; and what mechanism could be effective from a scientific perspective, encourage sufficient participation from the largest emitters, and ensure universal participation at the same time.Among the highlights in the history of efforts to resolve these questions, Luomi notes that the 2015 Paris Agreement was the first multilateral climate change agreement to place legally binding obligations for emission reductions on all countries. However, she explains, some have argued that the universality of the Paris Agreement came with a cost to its effectiveness: its success “hangs on the pledges that major emitters bring to the table and turn into action.”Luomi reports that currently, countries’ collective pledges on reducing emissions still allow for a global temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius, an amount that will have devastating consequences for both ecosystems and humans. To avoid this, emissions must fall much more sharply in the next ten years.The brief suggests there is a need to design instruments that can “adapt over time to evolving science and changing levels of socio-economic development,” and ensure that responsibility for action is equally distributed both intra- and inter-generationally.The author concludes that the history of climate change governance reveals the “ultimate challenge of governing the global commons, which is that even though multilateralism remains the best antidote to anarchy, it may be insufficient to avert catastrophic environmental damage unless global solidarity among the major polluters prevails.” [Publication:Global Climate Change Governance: The search for effectiveness and universality] [Still Only One Earth policy brief series]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"23 September 2019: The international shipping industry has launched a coalition that will bring together decision makers from across the shipping value chain to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50% by 2050 and enable the industry’s transition to full decarbonization. The ‘Getting to Zero Coalition’ will develop a roadmap outlining tangible steps to accelerate the deployment of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs).The Coalition is a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum, the Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum (WEF). Supported by Denmark, Ethiopia and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) through the Energy Transition Track of theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, the Coalition is backed by knowledge partners, including the University College London (UCL) Energy Institute, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and the Energy Transitions Commission.The Coalition builds on thePoseidon Principles, a global framework for integrating climate considerations into lending decisions to promote decarbonization of international shipping launched in June 2019, and has been signed by more than 50 leaders across the maritime industry, financial institutions and other stakeholders.To achieve the Coalition’s goals, commercially viable ZEVs must start entering the global fleet by 2030, and their numbers must be radically scaled through the 2030s and 2040s. The roadmap the Coalition undertakes to develop by January 2021 will include concrete steps to accelerate the deployment of ZEVs through,inter alia:Visible and transformative leadership that can shift the industry consensus, increase understanding of what is possible and raise ambitions;A shared knowledge base of integrated decarbonization pathways to enable alignment and critical mass that can help shift the entire sector;Investment in analytics to focus on the fuels, ships, market drivers and policies necessary to make the transition to commercially viable and scalable ZEVs possible through technology, safety, economic incentives and regulation; andCatalyzing demonstrations, pilot projects and tests that can demonstrate the viability of different technologies, leverage best practices and inform investment decisions and regulations to speed up ZEVs’ deployment.The Coalition was launched during the Climate Action Summit on 23 September.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has announced that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (Nigeria) is “best poised to attain consensus” to become its seventh Director-General. The US, however, has indicated it does not support Okonjo-Iweala’s candidacy.Speaking at a Heads of Delegation meeting on 28 October, WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand) recommended Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment as the next Director-General. He said her candidacy “carried the largest support” by members from all levels of development and all geographic regions – in the final round of consultations as well as throughout the process.“This was the assessment of the “troika” of facilitators,” Walker stressed, and members need to take a formal decision at a General Council meeting scheduled for 9 November. According to a WTO press release, the US challenged this assessment, indicating it would continue to support Yoo Myung-hee (Republic of Korea) to succeed former Director-General Roberto Azevêdo.Walker, with Chair of the Dispute Settlement Body Dacio Castillo (Honduras) and Chair of the Trade Policy Review Body Harald Aspelund (Iceland), conducted consultations with members from 19-27 October as part of the third and final stage of the selection process, which aims “to secure a consensus decision by members.”On 14 May 2020, Roberto Azevêdo (Brazil)announcedthat he would step down from his post on 31 August. During the first phase of the Director-General selection process,eight countriesnominated candidates for the post. The candidates “made themselves known to members” during the second phase of the selection process.On 31 July, the General Council decided that thethird and final phasewould consist of three stages of confidential consultations, which would take place over a two-month period, starting on 7 September. During these consultations, the field of candidates was reduced fromeight to fiveand then fromfive to two.According to theprocedures for the Director-General selection process, adopted by WTO members in 2002, the key consideration in determining which candidate is likely to achieve consensus is the “breadth of support” they receive from members. According to the WTO, the 2005 and 2013 Director-General selection processes defined breadth of support as “the distribution of preferences across geographic regions and among the categories of Members generally recognized in WTO provisions,” namely least developed countries (LDCs), developing countries, and developed countries. Walker indicated that based on the General Council’s decisions, “breadth of support means the larger membership.” [WTO Press Release] [Statement by General Council Chair]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"29 July 2019: The NAP Global Network has published a brief examining country perspectives on alignment of national-level policy processes under the Paris Agreement on climate change as a basis for broader alignment towards climate-resilient development.The brief titled, ‘Alignment to Advance Climate-resilient Development: Country Perspectives on Alignment of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),’ is based on country perspectives gathered during a Peer Learning Summit with 16 countries (Benin, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo, Uganda and Viet Nam) in October 2018, as well as two national workshops in Grenada and Peru that explored alignment of NDCs and NAP processes in detail.Alignment of the NDCs and NAPs under the Paris Agreement, the brief argues, may represent a “feasible” starting point in many countries and a “strong foundation” for alignment with other agendas. Highlighting the complementary and mutually supportive nature of NDCs and NAPs, the brief notes that NDCs provide “high-level direction and principles” for climate action, while NAP processes “elaborate adaptation options and strategies for implementation.”The brief outlines challenges faced by countries in aligning their NDCs and NAP processes as well as opportunities for increasing coherence, efficiency and effectiveness. It notes that many countries wish to increase the alignment between their NDCs and NAP processes, and are able to identify key actions to achieve this, which include using the NAP process to: inform the development of future NDCs; improve the quality of adaptation-related information; and add value and enhance countries’ adaptation goals.This is the third in a series of NAP Global Network briefs on aligning national policies and implementation efforts under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), which aims to increase understanding of alignment at the country level. Thefirst briefintroduced the concept of alignment and explored the varying degrees of it. Thesecond briefidentified the ways in which countries can initiate alignment by defining objectives, identifying entry points and putting in place enabling factors.The NAP Network secretariat is hosted by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

"A group of 155 companies representing a combined market capitalization of USD 2.4 trillion have signed a statement urging governments to align their COVID-19 economic aid and recovery efforts with the latest climate science.The companies, which are all members of theScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi), employ 5 million people, are headquartered in 33 countries, and span 34 sectors. Theirstatementcalls on governments to build resilience against future shocks by aligning policies with the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C by achieving net zero emissions well before 2050. The companies pledge to continue to: demonstrate that the best decisions and actions are grounded in science; invest in recovery and resilience for a systemic socioeconomic transformation; and work with governments and scale up the movement.Signatories include AstraZeneca, Bayer, Coca-Cola European Partners, Colgate Palmolive Company, EDF Group, EDP Energias de Portugal, Enel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Iberdrola, Inter IKEA Group, Intuit, JLL, Mars, Nestlé, Orange, PensionDanmark, Salesforce.com inc, and Unilever, among others.A net zero-aligned recovery will enable companies to invest and innovate at the pace and scale necessary to build back better.As members of the SBTi, the companies all haveestablished, or pledged to establish, science-based emissions targets. In joining the statement, the companies reaffirm their own commitments to achieving a zero-carbon economy, and urge governments to match their ambition by “aligning policies and recovery plans with the latest climate science.”The statement comes at a time when governments across the world are mobilizing trillions of dollars in economic stimulus packages to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are also preparing to submit enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change this year.The statement was organized by the SBTi, and its campaign partners with Business Ambition for 1.5°, the UN Global Compact, and the We Mean Business coalition. The SBTi independently assesses and validates corporate climate targets against climate science and is a collaboration between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed “the ambitious, science-based actions we are seeing from leading companies who are demonstrating to policymakers that green growth remains the best growth strategy.” “A net zero-aligned recovery will enable companies to invest and innovate at the pace and scale necessary to build back better, creating decent jobs, protecting health, reducing emissions and increasing resilience in the future,” said Maria Mendiluce, CEO, We Mean Business.

"The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) considered and declined a proposal to hold an exceptional meeting of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) to discuss the draft ministerial declaration of the HLPF session that convened in July 2020.Leading up to the 2020 HLPF session, UN Member States attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration to be adopted during the HLPF’s closing session. However, they were unable to reach agreement on a final text within the time frame of the session. TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreportedthat this has become the norm, but if the meeting had been taking place in person, governments would have been able to adopt it by a vote. “In the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was found.On 8 September, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal (E/2021/L.8) for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, “as early as possible during the 2021 session of the Council.”In the plenary meeting on 14 September 2020, the Council took up the draft decision but did not adopt it. Delegations raised procedural concerns about an exceptional session, and noted that by the current rules, a ministerial declaration should only be considered once per ECOSOC cycle.Among other objections, Germany for the EU said the text proposed by the G-77/China does not match the document placed under silence procedure during the 2020 session; Canada cautioned against rushing negotiations on such an important text; and Australia said the way forward is to focus on the 2021 HLPF session.ECOSOC President Munir Akram agreed to pursue consultations with interested delegations and seek advice from the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs.

"A high-level event that convened during the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 25) addressed the impacts of climate change on the achievement of SDG 2 (zero hunger). It discussed the important role of technological innovation in overcoming this challenge.The event titled, ‘Linking Technological Innovation and Climate Change Actions for a World Free of Hunger, Malnutrition, and Poverty,’ underscored the importance of bringing SDG 2 into climate discussions.Addressing participants, Luis Planas Puchades, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Spain, highlighted the important role of technology and innovation in creating sustainable, climate-friendly agricultural practices. Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Minister of Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Zimbabwe, pointed out the need for innovation and the implementation of transformative adaptation and mitigation efforts, including climate-smart agriculture (CSA).Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Minister of Environment and Energy, Costa Rica, urged adding policy development to science, technology and action in the discourse on fighting climate change and achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. He stressed the need for ministries of environment and agriculture to work together to ensure more sustainable and environmentally-friendly food production.Speakers also: noted that traditional knowledge and observations by indigenous peoples can help predict weather and climatic conditions, which can be used to enhance food security; underscored the need to incorporate traditional knowledge into national planning processes; stressed the need to empower farmers; called for placing traditional knowledge on the same footing as western science to achieve the SDGs; and urged coherence between farmers, governments and the private sector.This event, which convened on 12 December, was organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has released the first in a series of three New Nature Economy (NNE) reports to be published this year. The series will make the case for why the nature crisis is crucial to business and the economy; identify a set of priority socioeconomic systems for transformation; and scope the market and investment opportunities for nature-based solutions to environmental challenges.Titled ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ the first report presents four chapters discussing the nature emergency, the risks of nature loss to businesses, how to manage these risks, and how to take action. The publication’s appendix offers an approach to modelling nature dependency for countries and sectors.In their foreword, Dominic Waughray, Managing Director, Managing Board, World Economic Forum and Celine Herweijer, Global Leader, Innovation and Sustainability, PwC, United Kingdom, note that “every industry sector has some degree of direct and indirect dependency on nature” and identify nature loss as a “fat-tail risk like the 2008 asset-price bubble.” They point out that pursuing a “nature-positive way of doing business” can mitigate future economic and societal shocks.Nature loss is a “fat-tail risk like the 2008 asset-price bubble.”The report goes on to discuss how risks to nature manifest as risks to business across all sectors. They highlight the report’s findings, which indicate “that $44 trillion of economic value generation – more than half of the world’s total GDP – is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and is therefore exposed to nature loss.”The report follows on the heels of the WEF’sGlobal Risks Report, which for the first-time in the report’s 10-year history listed the top five risks in terms of likelihood as environmental.The NNE series, which is produced in collaboration with PwC, is being developed under the umbrella of the WEF’s Nature Action Agenda, a platform for mobilization and support in the lead up to the UN Biodiversity Conference in October 2020, at which time a new global biodiversity framework is expected to be adopted.

"The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has drafted a manual focused on green and sustainable chemistry, in advance of the fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5). The concepts of green and sustainable chemistry have gained significant attention globally, given their potential to help achieve the SDGs and their targets. A final version of the manual – which was requested by UNEA-4 in 2019 – is expected to be available soon.The publication titled, ‘Green and Sustainable Chemistry: Framework Manual‘, is aimed at countries and stakeholders. It discusses why green and sustainable chemistry is needed, what it aims to achieve, and how to advance it through enabling tools and measures. It also provides an overview of the evolution of the concepts. ‘Green chemistry’ was elaborated through12 principlesfirst published in 1998, while ‘sustainable chemistry’ is more holistic.The report highlights ten green and sustainable chemistry objectives, namely: minimizing chemical hazards; avoiding regrettable substitutions and alternatives; sustainable feedstock and resource sources; advancing sustainable production processes; advancing sustainable products; minimizing chemical releases and pollution; enabling non-toxic circularity; maximizing social benefits; protecting workers, consumers, and vulnerable populations; and developing solutions for sustainability challenges.The manual recommends specific actions for various stakeholders. Governments could provide dedicated support to green and sustainable research programmes in industry and the research community. Universities could introduce green and sustainable chemistry into teaching curricula, research operations, and start-up support. Chemical companies could introduce life-cycle assessment approaches throughout the value chain and set targets for replacing chemicals of concern through innovation. Civil society organizations could bring knowledge to consumers to help create demand for green and sustainable chemicals and products.To support these and other actions, the manual provides or discusses:Enabling sector policies and programmes that advance innovation in green and sustainable chemistry;Metrics, assessment tools, and reporting schemes relevant for tracking progress and advancing green and sustainable chemistry;The need for road maps that help advance green and sustainable chemistry action in different settings, including by replicating good practices;Enabling tools and measures to advance green and sustainable chemistry, such as promoting life cycle approaches; andScaling up awareness raising and education initiatives to bring the green and sustainable chemistry agenda to relevant stakeholders.The Framework Manual builds on a 2019 UNEP report titled, ‘Analysis of Stakeholder Submissions on Sustainable Chemistry Pursuant to UNEA Resolution 2/7.’ That document summarized more than 50 examples of best practices in sustainable chemistry. It concluded that despite progress made, identifying best practices is a challenge, given the absence of common assessment criteria, and encouraged working towards a common understanding of the sustainable chemistry concept.The manual also builds on the second edition of the Global Chemicals Outlook (GCO-II), also released in 2019. GCO-II provides insights regarding opportunities toward advancing green and sustainable chemistry throughout value and supply chains, including measures to strengthen an enabling framework.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"A side event on nature-based solutions showcased collaborative actions between agencies, funds and programmes to address climate issues through the lens of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, particularly SDG 15 (life on land). The event took place during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain.The event titled, ‘Nature-Based Solutions on the Ground (SDG 15): UN Support to People and Landscapes,’ convened on 9 December 2019, with the participation of UN agencies and partners representing indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs), the private sector and youth.In opening remarks, Ovais Sarmad, UNFCCC Secretariat, stressed the need to address land issues in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2020. Land conservation can provide 30% of mitigation potential required to meet the 2°C target, noted Grethel Aguilar, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Acting Director General.Echoing that land degradation neutrality is an essential link to address climate change as well as to achieve the SDGs, Ibrahim Thiaw, UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Executive Secretary, called for allocating 30% of climate financing for land-based solutions.Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, SDG Advocate, urged solutions to enable indigenous peoples to address climate change and implementation of rights-based approaches. She underscored that nature-based solutions cut across all the SDGs.During a land-based mitigation panel, speakers emphasized mutual trust and respect to maintain IPLCs’ contributions in nature-based solutions. They also: lamented that the Brazilian government has frozen USD 500 million of funds earmarked for Amazon conservation; called for global multi-stakeholder participation in community-led mitigation and adaptation; and noted that voluntary agreements, like the soy moratorium, are important instruments for private sector engagement.In a panel on adaptation, speakers described: IPLCs’ heightened awareness of climate change due to their experiences on the front lines of climate impacts; application of nature-based solutions in biosphere reserves to promote adaptation; and opportunities to learn from IPLC-led nature-based solutions to address climate change.During a panel discussion on mountain ecosystems, speakers highlighted that indigenous communities are leading the way on climate solutions. They noted the need for government support to address such challenges, and cited threats posed by melting glaciers to mountain communities, as well as the benefits of mountains for humans and ecosystems.The event was organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD), and the UN University (UNU).

"The Chilean Presidency of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC announced a renewed Climate Ambition Alliance, in which participating countries commit to accelerate action by 2020 and achieve net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050.UN Secretary-General António Guterres asked Chile to lead the Climate Ambition Alliance in the context of government’s role as the original host of COP25. During the September 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, President of Chile Sebastián Piñeralaunchedthe Alliance to accelerate the transformation needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and stabilize the global average temperature rise at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.In addition to 73 UNFCCC parties, 14 regions, 398 cities, 768 businesses and 16 investors are working to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.At the Climate Ambition event on the sidelines ofCOP 25in Madrid, Spain, Chile’s Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt said73 countrieshave “signaled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action plan” to the UNFCCC. She announced that an additional 11 countries have initiated an internal process to enhance ambition and to reflect this enhanced ambition in their national plans by 2020. Schmidt further announced that 73 parties to the UNFCCC, 14 regions, 398 cities, 768 businesses and 16 investors are working to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.The Alliance will also focus on implementing measures to strengthen the protection of forests and oceans. On adaptation, the Alliance will galvanize actions to improve water management, resilient infrastructure and sustainable cities.Schmidt observed that more leaders are joining this effort to show “that boosting NDC ambition is both necessary and possible.” She said Chile and the UK will work to mobilize additional actors to join the Alliance ahead of the next UNFCCC COP, which will meet in Glasgow, UK (COP 26).In Chile’s press release, COP 26 President Designate Claire O’Neill stressed the UK’s commitment to work together to tackle climate change, and called on every country to “come forward as soon as possible in 2020 with a more ambitious NDC.” UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa told Parties that joining the Alliance is a “concrete way to demonstrate that the world is united behind the imperative to boost ambition” and to “publicly commit to enhancing their national climate plans by 2020.”Addressing the event, Guterressaidhe is “deeply encouraged” by the Alliance’s growth, noting that the “shift from the grey to the green economy is on, and it is gathering pace.” He stressed that countries must honor their pledges to scale up national climate commitments every five years to reach “what the scientific community has defined as a must”: reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the five UN regional commissions have launched a project to help governments and businesses to keep transport networks and borders operational and facilitate the flow of goods and services, while minimizing the spread of COVID-19.Theproject, launched in May, will implement UN solutions, standards, guidelines, metrics, tools, and methodologies to help developing countries build transport, trade, and logistics resilience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project emphasizes the exchange of knowledge and good practices, and aims to help governments in developing and least developed countries (LDCs) to adapt to post-COVID-19 conditions using UN expertise, standards, tools, and guidance, while taking their local conditions into account.The project is comprised of three clusters to match standards and best practices in transport and trade facilitation, taking into account new concerns related to cross-border freight transport operations and trade transactions as a result of COVID-19.The first cluster, focused on contactless solutions and good practices, aims to reduce physical contact in cross-border supply chains by facilitating the flow of goods without spreading the virus. Such facilitation will be achieved by implementing UN conventions and standards for harmonized electronic exchange of data in digital transport corridors, border crossings and trade operations, and development of smart rail and road connectivity.The second cluster addresses maximizing connectivity and eliminating obstacles to cross-border trade and transport operations as a result of COVID-19. It seeks to promote synergies among border agencies by empowering national trade facilitation committees, improving customs automation, and identifying non-tariff barriers.The third cluster addresses collaborative solutions on transport, trade, and logistics operations by strengthening regional and sectoral cooperation. This cluster will focus on international transit issues, as well as sectoral cooperation for ports as nodes of the global maritime shipping network, which are based on regional and national contexts.The clusters build on UN conventions, standards, tools, and instruments such asUNCTAD’s Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA), theeTIR International System (TIR Convention), and theFramework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific. The clusters will also draw from regional intergovernmental cooperation platforms, and capacity-building programmes of the regional commissions.The project responds to a call to action by UN Secretary-General António Guterres to tackle the socioeconomic dimensions of COVID-19 and align with theUN frameworkfor the immediate socioeconomic response to COVID-19, which calls for improved connectivity and lower transaction and transport costs and is central to UN efforts to improve contactless, seamless, and cooperative transport and trade. Such efforts are expected to help economies recover better from COVID-19 and accelerate progress towards the SDGs.Funding for the project is managed by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).

"The World Bank has published a report that outlines economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic. The report aims to help countries align their development pathways with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies that promote climate resilience of food and water systems, energy, transport, and cities, among other sectors.The report titled, ‘World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization,’ highlights the “huge risks” climate change poses to countries’ long-term development and growth, with critical implications for poverty, food security, and health. In a foreword, Juergen Voegele, World Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development, cautions that all countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, are now facing “the compound impacts of the twin challenges” of climate change and COVID-19.The report notes that the ambition reflected in the first round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) would only limit global warming to 2.7-3.7°C above preindustrial levels. It warns that a continued focus on short- and medium-term targets could make decarbonization more difficult, and calls for long-term strategies to help countries develop sustainably. “By planning ahead, these strategies can boost new economic activity and innovations, creating the jobs of the future, while also securing a safer climate, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable,” said Mari Pangestu, World Bank’s Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships, at the report’s launch.The Outlook 2050 recognizes the need for a “bold economic transformation” to realize the vision of the Paris Agreement and make the SDGs “more achievable,” which includes aligning finance flows with low-emissions, climate-resilient development pathways. It proposes a “whole-of-economy” approach to decarbonization, which prioritizes four economy-wide strategic directions:Embed long-term climate priorities in countries’ macroeconomic frameworks;Embed long-term climate planning in national budgets and expenditure frameworks;Embed long-term climate objectives in financial sector regulations and incentives; andEmbed long-term climate objectives in systems planning.The report identifies cross-sectoral opportunities and makes recommendations across eight areas that are essential for achieving the SDGs: 1) transforming food systems; 2) protecting land-based ecosystems and carbon sinks; 3) transforming energy systems; 4) transforming mobility; 5) building low-carbon, more resilient urban areas; 6) transforming water systems; 7) transforming the ocean economy; and 8) digital transformation. The Outlook 2050 finds that investing in cross-sectoral opportunities, including as part of stimulus packages, can aid in a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.The report was launched on 24 June, during the ‘Kickstarting the Sustainable Recovery’ event series, organized by the World Bank’s Climate Change Group in partnership with Innovate4Climate. The series focused on the role of sustainable finance in the COVID-19 recovery to help countries “build back better and stronger.” [Publication:World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization] [Publication Landing Page] [World Bank Press Release]",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
"The EU and China discussed the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery, trade, climate change and the SDGs, bilateral relations, and other regional and international issues during the 22nd bilateral summit. The summit took place via videoconference on 22 June 2020.On economics and trade, the EU “recalled the joint commitment to work constructively and expeditiously towards the resolution of a number of market access and regulatory issues.” Noting “an unbalanced trade and investment relationship” between the EU and China, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, called for addressing market access barriers and more ambition from China to conclude negotiations on an investment agreement. Von der Leyen also urged China “to engage seriously” on a reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO), in particular on the future negotiations on industrial subsidies.On climate change, the EU urged China to live up to its commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change, and called for China to commit to ambitious domestic action to reduce emissions in the short term, including by addressing decarbonization in China’s next five-year plan. The EU further urged China to commit to climate neutrality “as soon as possible after 2050.” The EU also called on China to support sustainable development, especially in Africa.European Council President, Charles Michel, said the EU and China must work together on climate action, achieving the SDGs, and addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. He emphasized that engaging and cooperating with China “is both an opportunity and necessity,” and said the EU must recognize that “we do not share the same values, political systems, or approach to multilateralism.” Von der Leyen, said relations between the EU and China “must become more rules-based and reciprocal” to achieve a level playing field.Chinese President Xi Jinping identified three areas of work to ensure that China and the EU are: “two major forces for world peace and stability”; “two major markets for world development and prosperity”; and “two major civilizations for upholding multilateralism and improving global governance.”On the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU and China agreed on the importance of supporting vulnerable countries and populations, including through the Global Response Initiative. The EU called on China to participate in the World Health Assembly-mandated review of lessons learned on the international health response to COVID-19. The EU highlighted a shared responsibility to participate in global efforts to stop the virus’s spread, increase research on treatments and vaccines, and support a green and inclusive recovery.The EU emphasized the importance of results-oriented implementation of commitments made at the 2019 EU-China Summit. The EU stressed a need to advance negotiations on an EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement that ensures a “level playing field” and addresses “current asymmetries in market access,” including progress on technology transfer and transparent subsidies. The EU emphasized that data protection and respect of fundamental rights are critical in development of new technologies.Leaders discussed a number of other issues, including Hong Kong, human rights, and regional and international conflicts.

"June 2019: South Africa has launched the country’s first Green Transport Strategy (GTS) to promote a transport system that is environmentally friendly and helps boost economic growth and create jobs.In South Africa, the transport sector is the most rapidly growing source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its continued growth is expected to have an increasing impact on biodiversity, air quality, land resources and water quality. It accounts for 10.8% of emissions in the country, with road transport responsible for 91.2% of that.The GTS, launched by the Department of Transport (DoT) in 2018, aims to minimize the adverse impact of transport on the environment, while addressing current and future transport demands, and encourages electric vehicle use and public transport enhancement. The strategy is expected to lead to increased access to employment opportunities for poor communities due to improved public transport and public health benefits.The Strategy will,inter alia: enable the transport sector to contribute its “fair share” to national efforts to combat climate change; promote behavioral changes towards sustainable mobility alternatives through information, education and awareness raising; engage the sector’s low-carbon transition, to help align and develop policies that promote energy efficiency and emission control measures in all transport modes; and facilitate a just transition toward a climate resilient transport system.To achieve these objectives, the GST highlights :ensuring that South Africa has environmentally sustainable low carbon fuels by 2022 by converting 5% of the public and national sector fleet to cleaner alternative fuel and efficient technology vehicles;promoting fuel economy norms and standards and implementing regulations that promote improved efficiency in fossil-fuel powered vehicles;ensuring a modal shift from road to rail transport by encouraging a 30% shift for freight transport, from road to rail, and a 20% shift of passenger transport from private cars to public and eco-mobility transport;investing in green energy infrastructure, such as like biogas filling stations and electric car charging points;reviewing current levels of the environmental levy on new motor vehicle CO2 emissions and expanding it to commercial vehicles; andhelping ensure that freight vehicles only enter urban hubs during off-peak hours, by possibly implementing road freight permits and road-use charges.The strategy requires long-term finance and investment, as well as supplementary work to prepare detailed business plans for investing in transport-related mitigation, with economic opportunities in the public and private sectors. All GST interventions or measures must be ‘SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely,’ and an internal review period will be implemented every three years.

"The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) organized an event addressing their respective roles in blended finance during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain.The event, which convened on 9 December, discussed the ways in which the GEF and the GCF are using development capital to mobilize additional private finance to drive green investments and create new climate finance markets.It addressed,inter alia: engagement between development and climate finance institutions to scale investments; the ways in which innovative equity, grant, guarantee and lending instruments deployed by the GCF and GEF are used to de-risk scalable projects and contribute to achieving Paris Agreement goals in developing countries; their motivation and role in providing project structures that have had a catalytic impact of blending project capital stocks; and why private institutions should be interested in working with the two entities.Naoko Ishii, GEF CEO and Chairperson, underscored the need for radical changes in economic pathways and financing to support a shift to circular systems of food production and energy efficiency, among others.Yannick Glemarec, GCF Executive Director, said the organization is fostering a shift towards low emissions development in low income countries, and highlighted GCF’s: 95 accredited partners for co-financing and co-implementation; grant and non-grant instruments that are specific to different projects; and mechanisms to reduce or share risk by ensuring projects are aligned to national priorities.Speakers also highlighted:the Climate Resilience and Adaptation Finance and Technology-transfer Facility (CRAFT) to support the development and launch of the first private sector investment strategy for adaptation and resilience solutions;the need to replicate, scale up and standardize success stories;the need for transparency and full disclosure by investors on their activities;blended finance used to facilitate the retirement of carbon intensive stocks, such as fossil fuel investments;blended finance used to break through “sacred cows” that cause limitations on what is bankable or not, and build confidence for first time investors; andways to avoid crowding out private investment and ensuring optimization, and making public climate finance catalytic.[IISD RS Coverage of Side Event on Blended Finance] [GCF at COP 25 Website] [GEF at COP 25 Website]****IISD Reporting Services is providing coverage ofselected side eventsduring the UN Climate Change Conference, which convened from 2- 13 December 2019.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"20 September 2019: More than 20 cities, including Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), Dakar (Senegal), Helsinki (Finland), Paris (France), La Paz (Bolivia), Melaka (Malaysia) and São Paulo (Brazil), have endorsed a statement on urban development that integrates environmental considerations, including low-emission targets, local biodiversity action plans, and nature-based solutions focused on enhancing green urban infrastructure and urban resilience.The ‘São Paulo Statement on Urban Sustainability: A Call to Integrate Our Responses to Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss, and Social Inequality’ argues that cities are part of the climate solution. In addition, the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to be adopted during the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Kunming, China, in 2020, is expected to enhance the ambition of cities to respond to biodiversity loss. Integrated urban planning can help cities and local governments support national climate and biodiversity goals.A Global Environment Facility (GEF) press release notes that while cities generate 80% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and drive economic transformation, they also consume two-thirds of global energy, and account for more than 70% of emissions, although only 55% of the world’s population resides in them. Compact and connected cities use fewer resources, while unplanned growth and urban sprawl can increase emissions, contributing the climate change. However, cities are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and, by 2050, as many as 143 million people could become climate migrants, a phenomenon that will disproportionately impact poorer communities.The statement calls for integrated solutions to urban development and social inequality that mitigate climate change and avoid biodiversity loss to create opportunities for green, low-carbon and competitive urban growth while building resilient, inclusive and livable cities.More specifically, the statement explains that while each city faces unique challenges, many have implemented one or more of the following in order to develop their own integrated solutions:setting low-emission targets with the aim of becoming carbon neutral;developing and implementing local biodiversity action plans to conserve and enhance urban biodiversity and urban protected areas;integrating climate and biodiversity information into spatial planning, while investing in compact and connected urban development;bringing nature closer to people by restoring connectivity and green corridors between urban areas, surrounding landscapes and protected areas;supporting social inclusion while addressing climate change, biodiversity loss and economic development; andpromoting nature-based solutions (NbS) to enhance ecosystem functions.The São Paulo Statement was launched during the 3rd Global Meeting of the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPSC), which convened under the theme, ‘Catalyzing Sustainable Urban Futures,’ and took place from 16-20 September in São Paulo, Brazil. The conference was organized by GPSC, with support from the GEF, São Paulo City Hall and Brazil’s Sustainable Cities Program.

"15 August 2019: The Mountain Partnership Secretariat (MPS) published its ‘Annual Report 2018,’ highlighting its work in the areas of advocacy, communication and knowledge management, mainstreaming mountains, brokering joint action, and leading capacity development initiatives. The publication also presents plans for 2019 and beyond.The report underscores achievements such as celebrating International Mountain Day with more than 100 events in over 35 countries and training participants of the International Programme on Research and Training on Sustainable Management of Mountain Areas on topics such as bio-economy. Although it is not a comprehensive report of all members’ activities, the publication provides a sampling of the work of Mountain Partnership members in 2018, which ranged from introducing a national law for organic agriculture in Kyrgyzstan to safeguarding indigenous food systems in mountains and training young guides in the mountainous Swat region of Pakistan.By the text, in 2018 the Mountain Partnership’s constituency grew to 353 members, with 60 governments, 16 intergovernmental organizations, and 277 major group organizations committed to achieving sustainable mountain development around the world. Together with member governments, the Secretariat worked on implementing the Framework for Action to mainstream mountains in the 2030 Agenda, with events at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, US, and at the World Mountain Forum in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The Secretariat also organized courses on sustainable mountain development and agro-biodiversity, and held a workshop on the Mountain Green Cover Index to strengthen members’ expertise.The #MountainsMatter campaign triggered over 13,000 tweets.Going forward, Yuka Makino, MPS Coordinator, explains that the MPS’ vision is to strengthen the engagement and ownership of the Partnership for all members. To this end, she mentions that the Secretariat is working with members to conduct outreach beyond the traditional constituency, forge strategic alliances, and connect with friends of mountains who can convey key messages into new arenas. Towards these goals, in 2018, the MPS also launched the #MountainsMatter campaign, a social media movement to rally support for mountains and mountain peoples, engage a greater and more diverse global audience, and speak to policy-makers. To date, the campaign triggered over 13,000 tweets using the hashtag #MountainsMatter.The reports highlights that 2019 “will be a crucial year for highlighting climate change action,” adding that mountains need to be part of the discussion. As key opportunities for that, the publication identifies the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit to take place on 23 September 2019 in New York, as well as the report on sustainable mountain development that he will present at the upcoming session of the UN General Assembly. These opportunities, the report explains, will provide the Mountain Partnership’s members a chance to highlight what has been achieved and provide recommendations to UN Member States.

"The World Resources Institute (WRI) and ClimateWorks Foundation have released a report that assesses progress and opportunities to align emissions trajectories with the global average temperature increase of 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. The publication explores global and country-level emissions progress across six key sectors.The report titled, ‘State of Climate Action: Assessing Progress toward 2030 and 2050,’ evaluates progress towards 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets across 21 benchmark indicators developed by the Climate Action Tracker and WRI in the power, buildings, industry, transport, forests, and agricultural sectors. According to the report, two benchmark indicators – agricultural crop yields and ruminant meat consumption – show an historic rate of change sufficient to meet emissions reduction targets. Thirteen of the indicators, including the share of renewables in electricity generation, energy intensity of buildings, carbon intensity of cement production, share of electric vehicles in annual new car sales, and gross tree cover gain, present “change headed in the right direction,” but at a pace too slow to achieve the targets. Two of the indicators – deforestation and emissions from agricultural production – show historic rates of change headed in the wrong direction. Four indicators do not offer sufficient data for analysis.WRI highlights some of theimpacts of climate change, such as the spread of wildfires, increased intensity of storms and heatwaves, the breakup of ice sheets, and disappearance of glaciers. In order to limit warming to 1.5°C, WRI states, global emissions must be halved by 2030, which will require significant financial investment, technology transfer, and capacity building in developing countries. Halving emissions by 2030 also requires a fivefold acceleration in the share of renewables in electricity generation, the increase of annual tree cover gain, and the phase out of coal in electricity generation. Additionally, the carbon intensity of electricity generation will need to be reduced by a factor of three, the uptake of electric vehicles will need to increase 22 times the rate of uptake from recent years, and the share of low-carbon fuels must increase eightfold.The report notes that exponential systemic change is achievable, proven by transitions caused by the advent of technology in cars, telephones, and computers. While climate finance has increased significantly across the public, private, and philanthropic sectors, the report argues it has not yet achieved the scale needed to revolutionize energy, transportation, and energy efficiency, and protect forests. The report states an estimated USD 1.6 trillion – 3.8 trillion is needed on an annual basis through 2050 to transform the global energy sector alone.As countries update their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference and develop long-term low-emission development strategies (LEDS), and trillions of dollars are mobilized to support COVID-19 recovery, the opportunity still exists to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the report notes. This, WRI emphasizes, will require smart and proactive investments in key sectors.

"25 September 2019: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued a report discussing ways public governance can strengthen SDG implementation, based on experiences, good practices and lessons learned from countries around the world. Among other purposes, the publication supports a new initiative from the OECD and the UN Development Programme on governance of the SDGs.The publication titled, ‘Governance as an SDG Accelerator: Country Experiences and Tools,’ includes sections on: whole-of-government and policy coherence; stakeholder participation and open government; effective use of budgeting and public procurement tools; monitoring, evaluation and audit insitutions; fostering a culture of integrity and fighting corruption; and governance frameworks to ensure equal access to justice and citizens’ legal empowerment, and to support gender equality. Each chapter is accompanied by case studies.The VNRs show a lack of reflection and understanding about including evaluation in national follow-up and review processes.The report was published on 16 July 2019 to coincide with the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). It is meant as a “live repository” of experiences, good practices and lessons learned from countries’ governance challenges related to the SDGs.The report finds that none of the countries reviewed has fully integrated their SDGs into its budgeting exercise, but case studies from Egypt, Paraguay and Slovakia show how results-based resource allocations can help strengthen accountability mechanisms. As mentioned in thisbrochureon the publication, setting high-level goals and indicators is a first step for the effective use of budgeting tools, and needs to be followed by a national strategy plan, overall reporting and accountability system.On monitoring, evaluation and audit institutions, the report indicates that while most countries reviewed have established a monitoring framework for SDG implementation, only a few have addressed the question of how to evaluate SDG achievements. It further notes that a review of 43 Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) refers to “a general lack of reflection and understanding about how evaluation should be included into the SDGs’ national follow-up and review processes.”Among the case studies included in the report, Indonesia, Lithuania, Thailand and the UK illustrate the relevance of tackling corruption to achieve sustainable development and the importance of promoting integrity through a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. Australia, Canada and the UK provide insights on how to assess legal needs and facilitate access to justice to vulnerable groups, like indigenous communities, women, and socially and economically disadvantaged people through a comprehensive approach. Iceland, Kazakhstan, Lithuania and Mexico case studies include examples of gender mainstreaming practices to position gender equality at the core of national development goals.The publication provides empirical evidence to the Global Hub for the Governance of the SDGs, which was launched on 25 September 2019. The Global Hub is a joint initiative of OECD and UNDP, and seeks to facilitate targeted support to interested countries on specific SDG-related governance challenges.

"The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs has synthesized 39 governments’ reports on how COVID-19 is affecting SDG implementation in their countries, as presented during their voluntary national reviews of SDG implementation at the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.According to the DESA policy brief released on 14 September 2020, 39 out of 46 VNR reports presented at the 2020 HLPF explicitly mentioned the impact of the pandemic on SDG implementation. The reports showed that small, vulnerable, highly indebted, and tourism-dependent states have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Some governments suggested that if SDG implementation had been at a more advanced stage before the pandemic, its impacts may have been less severe.If SDG implementation had been more advanced, the pandemic’s impacts may have been less severe, countries said in their 2020 VNRs.Governments also reported on how the crisis affected stakeholder consultations planned for the last phase of VNR preparations. Amid lock-down measures, several countries aimed to reach stakeholders and NGOs by posting reports online and inviting proposals and descriptions of their work to include in the report. Some countries tried to reach remote communities through phone interviews or community radio stations. Others reported that some stakeholders, such as youth, were able to participate in consultations through virtual means.The DESA brief reports that most countries’ VNRs underlined the importance of multilateralism and global solidarity in order to recover from COVID-19 and achieve the SDGs. Another strong message was the need for “a coordinated international response to the pandemic and for cooperation by all stakeholders.”Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, the President of the UN Economic and Social Councilannouncedthat only 42 countries will be able to present VNRs, with priority for countries presenting VNRs for the first time. So far, 30 countries haveexpressed interest. The 2021 session will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’It will focus in particular on nine SDGs: Goal 1 (No poverty); Goal 2 (Zero hunger); Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing); Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth); Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities); Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production); Goal 13 (Climate action); Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline. [Publication:Impact of COVID-19: perspective from Voluntary National Reviews] [DESA News]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The International Trade Centre (ICT) has released a report that analyzes opportunities for integrating online marketplaces in Africa with African economies. The report finds an increase in Africa’s use of digital trade in response to COVID-19 restrictions, and emphasizes the “vast untapped potential” of online marketplaces in Africa.The publication titled, ‘Business and Policy Insights: Mapping e-Marketplaces in Africa,’ uses a new ITC database of online marketplaces across Africa to examine the extent of e-commerce on the continent. Overall, Africa has 631 online marketplaces, which recorded 2.2 billion visits in 2019. In 2019, the total traffic for African marketplaces made up less than 10% of the traffic on Amazon.com. Ten countries are responsible for 94% of all online business in Africa. South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Kenya together account for 78% of total marketplace traffic.Women must have more access to payment solutions for e-commerce to develop in Africa.The top challenge in accessing a marketplace is that it is often available only to sellers in certain locations, the report notes. The largest and most active sites are typically only present in the most advanced, biggest economies, rather than being widely available. The report finds, for instance, that only three of the ten international marketplaces analyzed are open to sellers from over 50 Africa countries.Other challenges for online marketplaces include limited internet access in rural areas, differing business environments from county to country, and the small size of African marketplaces by global standards. In 2017, for example, only 30% of Africans could go online. Further, 60% of Africans use cell phones to get online, and online payments typically require bank accounts and trust. In addition, women are typically the primary purchasers in their households but they are less likely to have a bank account or access to credit cards and mobile money. The report emphasizes women must have more access to payment solutions for e-commerce to develop in Africa.ITC Executive-Director, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, said the report “helps confirm the vast untapped potential of African e-commerce.” She emphasized the potential for online marketplaces to provide opportunities to invigorate trade across Africa and promote small enterprises. Cole-Hamilton said “negotiations on e-commerce and digital trade under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement have been fast-tracked,” and expressed support for making e-commerce in Africa inclusive and accessible.For e-commerce to advance in Africa, the report recommends countries develop modern, technologically and commercially advanced marketplaces. The report suggests countries take steps to “promote innovation, attract investment and encourage competition,” and upgrade the quality and reach of e-commerce by improving internet access, commercial infrastructure, and financial systems. The report recommends policymakers invest in technology and help develop cross-border e-commerce. It further recommends e-marketplaces help African entrepreneurs attain the know-how to participate in the marketplaces, including through classroom-based training and online courses to teach entrepreneurs how to use their services.

"The third brief in IISD’s ‘Still Only One Earth’ series highlights that illegal wildlife trade can lead to the spread of zoonoses, such as SARS-CoV-2 that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.The policy brief titled, ‘The Evolving War on Illegal Wildlife Trade,’ is authored by Tanya Rosen. Rosen reports that the world’s more “charismatic” species as well as lesser known ones are suffering unprecedented declines due to trafficking and unsustainable trade in wildlife commodities including elephant ivory, rhino horn, pangolin scales, tiger bone, and bear bile. Wildlife crime is the fourth-largest illegal global trade, she notes, following narcotics, counterfeiting, and human trafficking.The focus of the policy brief series is on lessons from sustainable policy and governance, and Rosen explores the effectiveness of the only existing international convention to address trade in wild specimens of flora and fauna – the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The brief notes that many species being illegally traded are not listed through CITES, and that enforcement is challenged by the lack of an agreed definition of wildlife crime. An emerging challenge for CITES amid COVID-19 is that the prospect of further restricting wildlife trade could “send that trade underground.” Rosen notes that the threat of more pandemics “looms large,” and is expected to affect conservation and efforts to curb illegal wildlife trade.The brief concludes with a recommendation: while countries may be willing to enter into a new, stronger agreement, they should first consider whether CITES can further adapt to better curb illegal wildlife trade and address the challenges brought by COVID-19.The policy brief series draws on the environmental negotiation insights of the globalENB team. The briefs aim to guide future efforts to address the causes of climate change, support the sustainable management of natural resources, and foster fair and sustainable economies. [Publication:The Evolving War on Illegal Wildlife Trade] [Still Only One Earth series] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on launch of series]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"24 September 2019: Ahead of the Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, co-leads of the Resilience and Adaptation Coalition, Egypt and the UK, with coalition partners, Bangladesh, Malawi, the Netherlands and Saint Lucia, supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), issued a Call for Action on Adaptation and Resilience, advocating for a vision that puts adaptation at the center of decision making.As of 23 September, the Call for Action has been supported by 112, mostly developing, countries, 16 UN agencies and international financial institutions and 68 organizations.We must step up efforts to close the gap in adaptive capacity and financing, and to remove the barriers that hinder the uptake of knowledge and technology.Recognizing that adaptation action is not keeping pace with the scale of climate change impacts, which is such that business-as-usual (BAU) “is no longer an option for any country, community, business or financial institution,” the Call to Action states that “equal and increased urgency” must be given to adaptation to impacts and to building resilience for the future. It warns that while the true costs of adaptation in developing countries could amount to USD 300 billion per year by 2030, there are “substantial benefits to be gained from acting now.” “We must step up efforts to close the gap in adaptive capacity and financing, and to remove the barriers that hinder the uptake of knowledge and technology,” the Call notes.The Call envisions a climate-resilient future where adaptation is placed at the core of decision making, immediate action is taken to protect people, economies and the environment and no person is left behind by the impacts of climate change.The Call urges for enhanced adaptation and resilience action in three areas:Acting now to respond to immediate climate impacts and to support the most vulnerable members of society, including by: scaling up disaster readiness and response capacity and improving access to climate risk insurance; intensifying efforts to increase food and water security; and prioritizing regional and country-owned approaches, especially in small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs);Building resilient futures by putting climate risk at the center of decision making, including by: integrating adaptation and resilience into long-term planning; increasing the resilience of economies and financial systems by integrating climate risk into investment decision making and business planning; and accelerating transition to resilient land use and ecosystems; andUrgently increasing the availability of adaptation and resilience finance.Progress towards the Call’s goals will be assessed in the margins of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC and COP 26, including progress achieved through the various initiatives launched at the Climate Action Summit. The 2020 Global Adaptation Action Summit and theYear of Actionlaunched by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) will also serve as opportunities to further accelerate adaptation action.

"The International Labour Organization’s 2020 report on employment and social trends finds that income inequality is higher than previously thought, especially in developing countries, providing an indicator of social unrest.The ‘World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2020’ (WESO), which was released on 20 January 2020, uses new data and estimates of labor market inequalities. It finds, first, that although global unemployment has been stable for about nine years, slowing global growth means that not enough new jobs are being generated to ensure work for the entire global labor force. As a result, unemployment is projected to increase by around 2.5 million in 2020, and 188 million are already unemployed.Second, the report shows that unemployment is not the only type of “labor underutilization.” In addition, 165 million people don’t have enough paid work, and 120 million have either given up actively searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labor market. In total, almost half a billion people are working fewer paid hours than they would like, or lack adequate access to paid work.Third, inequalities by gender, age and geographic location affect labor markets and limit opportunities for workers as well as economic growth. ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said work-related inequalities and exclusion are preventing millions of people from finding decent work. He said this is “an extremely serious finding” with “profound and worrying implications for social cohesion.”The ILO press release also discusses working poverty, which is defined as earning less than USD 3.20 per day and affects over 630 million workers, or one in five workers globally. The ILO notes that as “moderate or extreme working poverty” in developing countries is “expected to edge up” over the next two years, it will be more difficult to achieve SDG 1 (no poverty).The annual WESO Trends report analyzes key labor market issues, including unemployment, labour underutilization, working poverty, income inequality, labor income share and factors that exclude people from decent work.

"A virtual ministerial meeting convened to highlight countries’ climate actions and environmental protection measures taken as part of COVID-19 recovery. The meeting launched an online platform to showcase such actions to build the global momentum towards the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in 2021.The ministerial, held virtually on 3 September 2020 and hosted by Japan’s Minister of the Environment, Koizumi Shinjiro, brought together ministers and representatives from more than 65 countries as well as non-state stakeholders, including youth, civil society, the private sector, and local governments.The meeting highlighted the role of climate, financial, and environmental protection policies in fostering transitions towards decarbonization, circular economy, and decentralization, which are “the cornerstone of our recovery from COVID-19.” Ministers exchanged information on their countries’ actions related to climate change and environmental protection as part of their recovery from COVID-19 in several key sectors and areas, including energy, transportation, urban planning, and adaptation. Non-state representatives offered perspectives on their roles in facilitating the socioeconomic transitions.Speaking at the ministerial, UN Secretary-General António Guterres recalled six climate-positive actions to recover better: invest in green jobs; do not bail out polluting industries; end fossil-fuel subsidies; take climate risks into account in all financial and policy decisions; work together; and leave no one behind. The Secretary-Generaloriginallyproposed thesix climate-positive actionsfor building back from COVID-19 on Earth Day on 22 April 2020.Launched during the meeting, the Online Platform for Sustainable and Resilient Recovery from COVID-19, ‘Platform for Redesign 2020,’ showcases policies and actions taken by national governments to contribute to a sustainable and resilient recovery from COVID-19 and “build back better” to achieve transformative change by redesigning economies and making societies more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive.

Consultations proceeded in writing, and a decision was reached to postpone the in-depth reviews of the HLPF and ECOSOC until the 75th UNGA session, focusing the present consultations only on “essential elements for the way forward.”By theagreed final text, the Assembly decides that the thematic focus of ECOSOC and HLPF in 2021 will be ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’The July 2021 session of the HLPF will focus in particular on nine SDGs:Goal 1: No povertyGoal 2: Zero hungerGoal 3: Good health and wellbeingGoal 8: Decent work and economic growthGoal 10: Reduced inequalitiesGoal 12: Responsible consumption and productionGoal 13: Climate actionGoal 16: Peace, justice, and strong institutionsGoal 17: Partnership for the GoalsThe review will also cover the targets of the SDGs with a 2020 timeline.The resolution states that the remainder of the current four-year HLPF cycle (2020-2023) will include an in-depth review of the other SDGs. The theme of the remaining HLPF sessions will be defined “as soon as possible” in the 75th UNGA session. Finally, governments decided that during UNGA 77 (2022-2023), the Assembly will agree on the themes and sets of goals to be reviewed at each session during the following HLPF cycle.Anearlier draftof the resolution (7 July) was under silence procedure but the silence wasbrokenover four paragraphs, as indicated in the letter from the co-facilitators. Among the changes between the final draft and the previous version, a paragraph has been removed regarding space for stakeholder input in the review process.

"23 September 2019: In advance of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, the UNFCCC relaunched the Global Climate Action portal with country profile pages and an interactive map. To date, the portal showcases over 22,471 climate commitments from 14,539 actors across all sectors of society.The website features new country profile pages that bring together climate actions by companies, organizations, cities and regions with governments’ national climate action plans. Governments’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and, where applicable, Long Term Climate Action Strategies are positioned alongside the commitments of non-Party stakeholders that are headquartered or located in that country. This feature aims to facilitate a picture of national-level climate action.As of 23 September, the Portal featured 22,471 actions from 175 countries, 9,465 cities, 279 regions, 2,688 companies, 955 investors, 977 organizations and 121 cooperation initiatives. The majority of commitments focus on emission reductions, which comprise 59% of all actions. Other actions include bonds insurance (14%) and carbon pricing (14%), renewable energy (10%), energy efficiency (3%) and resource consumption (1%). Seventy-four percent of actions are through 2020, compared to 9% of actions that go beyond 2030.The UNFCCC plans to update the portal with initiatives presented at the Climate Action Summit on 23 September by launching a dedicated “summit page.” In the future, the website will track progress on the commitments to support implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change post-2020 and towards the global stocktake (GST) in 2023.The UNFCCC launched a revamped version of the Climate Action Portal during the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in September 2018. The website was originally called the ‘NAZCA Portal,’ named after the ancient lines in Peru and launched during the Lima Climate Change Conference in 2014. The website was then enshrined in the Paris Agreement as the official portal to showcase contributions of non-Party stakeholders.

"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) have launched a project that aims to help countries improve their ability to monitor and track forest and land use change. These efforts are expected to contribute to tracking progress towards the SDGs and help developing countries meet enhanced transparency requirements under the Paris Agreement on climate change.The two-year project will build the capacity of developing countries to generate contribute to more reliable, available, accessible and transparent forest data. Through the project, FAO will upgrade the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA 2020) reporting platform, which stores data on the status and trends of the world’s forest resources. The FRA upgrade will enable easier access to reported data.The project will build country capacity in several ways. First, FAO is developing an e-learning course on transparency in the forest sector, which will be available to government forestry staff as well as other interested stakeholders, such as intergovernmental organizations, the private sector and academia. The project will organize sub-regional and national workshops in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean to build forest management capacity and introduce innovative forestry tools. Third, the project will identify and share case studies and best practices on transparency in the forest sector and develop communication and outreach materials to raise awareness on the importance of data collection, analysis and dissemination in increasing the forest sector’s transparency.The project is one of four global projects approved under the GEF’s ‘Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency’ (CBIT), a trust fund that aims to support countries in implementing the Paris Agreement and to strengthen countries’ institutional and technical capacities to meet the Paris Agreements’ enhanced transparency framework. FAO is contributing US$5.2 million to the project, and the GEF is providing US$1.9 million. [FAO Press Release] [CBIT Website]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
"5 September 2019: A study by the International Resource Panel (IRP), hosted by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), showcases the role of land restoration in achieving the SDGs and combating climate change. The report identifies land restoration and rehabilitation as one of three primary strategies for achieving SDG 15 (life on land), and particularly for meeting the land degradation neutrality (LDN) target under target 15.3.The publication titled, ‘Land Restoration for Achieving the SDGs,’ was released during the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which is taking place from 2-13 September 2019 in New Delhi, India.The report explains that restoring degraded land is often more of an “inspirational or aspirational” concept. In many cases, reverting land to an absolute pristine state is not feasible due to the high diversity of species in nature, some of which become extinct during the period of land degradation. In other cases, “modification of one or more factors that determine the land’s long-term potential may limit restoration.” However, the study emphasizes, rehabilitation towards restoration aimed at supporting the ability of land to deliver on its ecological services in a sustainable way is both possible and highly beneficial: restoring 350 million hectares of degraded landscapes by 2030, as aimed by the Bonn Challenge, could generate USD 9 trillion in ecosystem services while removing 13-26 gigatonnes (Gt) of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere.The study finds that while land restoration and rehabilitation can have significant co-benefits for all the SDGs, the extent of restoration co-benefits and potential risks and trade-offs vary significantly among the SDGs and their respective targets.The IRP uses a series of examples to illustrate co-benefits and trade-offs between the SDGs in the land restoration process. It recommends systemic analysis before investment is made, in order to avoid unintended consequences. For example, the publication notes, monoculture planting may help achieve a soils restoration objective under SDG 15 and, at the same time, provide benefits for the climate (SDG 13) through carbon sequestration, but it may fail to address biodiversity conservation (SDG 15).The publication identifies four strategies that can maximize the identification and leveraging of cross-cutting opportunities involving land restoration or rehabilitation and multiple SDGs:complete holistic and systematic analyses to identify potential synergies and tradeoffs;apply a landscape approach to planning and implementation – especially for landscapes with variable land potential;develop targeted solutions; andinvest in areas where persistence is likely.The report recommends quantitative and qualitative modelling, including scenario development, at both local and global scales, to guide future investments and coordinate projects. Adopting an integrated landscape approach is highlighted as essential to increasing the total return on land restoration investments.

"A study commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation finds a substantial bias towards men’s perspectives in newsgathering and news coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, in both the global north and the global south. The study provides 21 recommendations on amplifying the “substantially muted voices of women” in COVID-19 news coverage.The study titled, ‘The Missing Perspectives of Women in COVID-19 News: A special report on women’s under-representation in news media,’ released in September 2020, focuses on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, UK, and US. It draws on a computational news content analysis of 11,913 publications and 1.9 million stories between 1 March and 15 April 2020, as well as a mix of other quantitative and qualitative methodologies.The study finds that in the six countries analyzed, women are effectively political invisible in COVID-19-related decision-making processes. Moreover, in times of crisis, journalists may revert back to “established sources” who are significantly more likely to be men. The study finds that every individual woman’s voice in the news on COVID-19 is “drowned out by the voices of at least three, four, or five men.”The findings reveal not just how many women are represented in COVID-19 news, but also how they are portrayed in the story. The author explains that the women who are given a platform in the COVID-19 story are “rarely portrayed as authoritative experts or as empowered individuals but more frequently as sources of personal opinion or as victims/people affected by the disease.” Women constituted 19% of experts while men constituted 77% in the 175 most highly ranked COVID-19 articles across the six countries.In addition, few women feature as “protagonists” in COVID-19 news coverage, even less so than in news not related to COVID-19. The absence of women’s perspectives in COVID-19 news means that women have limited influence over the framing of the crisis. This results in limited influence over policymaking directions, and thus further marginalization within societies.Recommendations to redress the bias include steps to focus on women as sources of expertise and protagonists, cover gender equality, consider the implications of the framing of stories, and seek to understand the implications of reporting on women’s lives.The study is authored by Luba Kassova, international audience strategy consultancy AKAS Ltd. This report is the precursor to an expanded publication on the entire news value chain, commissioned in support of UN Women’sGeneration Equality Forum. The expanded study will offer a gender parity checklist for news providers around the world.

"17 July 2019: An event on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) considered the implementation of fundamental education reforms in Cameroon.The event took place on 17 July 2019, organized by the Permanent Mission of Cameroon to the UN and UN-Cameroon (the UN system in Cameroon), focused on access and quality of education, as well as on equity, in terms of inclusiveness. It also underscored the need for reforms at multiple levels to sensitize donors, governments and civil society regarding the urgency of investing in education.Panelists detailed significant progress in Cameroon regarding the expansion of access and reduction of gender disparities in schools, despite increased student enrollment. They cited a new education strategy aligned with SDG 4 (quality education). Speakers noted that poor effectiveness and low retention impede achieving universal education.Alamine Ousmane Mey, the country’s Minister of Economy, Planning and Regional Development, highlighted key aspects of education reforms in his country, namely promoting free tuition for primary education and reform of textbooks. He said low teacher retention is a challenge, and he called for more partnerships and support from all stakeholders to promote universal education.Allegra Maria Del Pilar Baiocchi, UN Development and Humanitarian Coordinator in Cameroon, lamented security threats due to terrorism, noting that “education is under attack” in some areas of the country. She called for more financial support to overcome such challenges. Baiocchi also mentioned theEducation Cannot Waitglobal fund, which aims to transform the delivery of education in emergencies.Joseph Oye, Sightsavers, discussed improving education for displaced children, refugees and children with disabilities. Pointing to the many organizations working on SDG 4 in Cameroon, he also stressed that challenges include data gaps and lack of teacher specialization, for example on children with disabilities.During the discussion, participants called for disaggregated data by gender, particularly related to disabled female students, and methods to enhance SDG implementation in an integrated manner.HLPF 2019 took place from 9-18 July in New York, US.

"To mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the UN, United Kingdom, and France, in partnership with Chile and Italy, co-convened a high-level event to mobilize commitments for addressing the global climate challenge.Only countries and stakeholders making new and ambitious announcements were given a speaking slot during the virtual event. The 111 speakers included Heads of State and Government as well as non-governmental actors representing youth, subnational governments, business, Indigenous peoples, and civil society.The golden thread of climate action should weave through every international gathering in 2021.COP 26 President-designate SharmaTheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreport of the event, which took place on 12 December 2020, indicates that statements coalesced around four themes: new and enhanced Paris Agreement medium-term plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs); long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies, as requested by the Paris Agreement, and mid-century, net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) and GHG emissions targets; adaptation plans and strategies; and climate finance.Seventy-five leaders announced new commitments, some of which had been communicated in recent months or days, or indicated ongoing work. Among the major announcements were China’s NDC-related commitment to lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% by 2030, from 2005 levels; the European Union’s NDC-related pledge to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030; and the UK’s NDC-related target of reducing GHG emissions at least 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.Additional pledges included:Net zero-related pledgesby Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden;Adaptation pledgesby Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; andClimate finance pledgesincluding from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, and the UK.The Cities Race to Zero – part of the global Race to Zero Campaign – was joined by 72 new cities and local authorities from Belgium, China, Denmark, and the UK. And companies from the manufacturing, industry, aviation, transport, technology, and fashion industries offered mitigation pledges.In his closing remarks, COP 26 President-designate Alok Sharma, UK, announced that the UK will double its climate finance contribution to USD 15.5 billion over the next five years.In all, Sharma said 45 NDCs, 24 net zero commitments, and 20 adaptation and resilience plans were announced during the event. He called for “the golden thread of climate action to weave through every international gathering” in 2021.

"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has released its second SDG Progress Report. It provides updates on the status of the global indicators for which FAO serves as the statistical custodian. The indicators under FAO custodianship measure global targets for SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 14 (life below water), 15 (life on land).The report titled, ‘Tracking Progress on Food and Agriculture-related SDG Indicators 2020: A Report on the Indicators under FAO Custodianship,’ was released on 15 September 2020.The first such report, issued in 2019, found that the world was not going to meet most of the SDG targets related to food and agriculture by 2030. In the second report, the FAO finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has not only made it even more difficult to achieve the SDGs, and more unlikely that the food and agriculture targets will be met on time, but it has also made it more difficult to monitor progress.Among the findings on SDG progress:The prevalence of undernourishment is stagnating, and food insecurity is worsening;Practices to conserve genetic resources have been disrupted, but in Northern Africa, efforts have increased;Countries’ legal provisions do not adequately protect the rights of women to land, with only 12% of those assessed providing a very high degree of legal protection;In Central and Southern Asia and Northern Africa, water stress levels are very high, but globally they are at a safe level;In Southern Asia, water use efficiency has improved;An estimated 13.8% of food is lost after harvest on farm and in transport, storage, and processing (it is not yet possible to estimate food waste at retail and consumption stages);Most countries have made good overall progress in implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing;Globally, forest area continues to decrease, though at a slightly slower rate; andThe world has made some progress towards sustainable forest management.Among the findings on how the pandemic has affected SDG monitoring, the report notes that COVID-19 disrupted national agricultural censuses in many countries, meaning they were delayed, postponed, or suspended. Such censuses are key to identifying immediate needs, the authors note. In addition, for one in four countries surveyed, nearly all data collection by national statistical agencies was adversely affected, “vastly complicating FAO’s work as the custodian agency” for the global SDG indicators.The FAO is turning to alternative data sources to continue monitoring trends and to ensure real-time assessment of how disruptions caused by the pandemic are affecting food systems. It reports that satellite imagery and machine-learning models are being integrated with other data sets.FAO notes that it has set up aBig Data laboratoryand tool to gather real-time information for a series of indicators, aFood Price Monitoring and Analysistool, and theHand in Hand Geospatial Platform.

"25 June 2019: Almost 16% of global gross domestic product (GDP) is covered by net zero emission targets set by countries, regions and cities, according to an Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) analysis that maps global progress towards net zero carbon emissions by mid-century.According to the report titled, ‘Countdown to Zero: Plotting Progress Towards Delivering Net Zero Emissions by 2050,’ 15 countries have announced their intention to achieve this target, with Norway and Sweden setting targets in national legislation, and Bhutan and Suriname already absorbing more greenhouse gases (GHGs) than they emit. In addition, 11 states and regions, including California and Scotland, and at least 23 cities, including Barcelona, Los Angeles and New York, have made similar announcements. At least 34 companies with annual income above USD 1 billion have set net zero emission targets, with some having already met the goal.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C(SR15) highlighted that to meet this goal, governments must collectively reach net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. According to the report, increasingly, the existence of a net zero target and an implementation plan is the most important single indicator of a country’s commitment to delivering on the goals of the Paris Agreement and contributing its share towards combating climate change.Even in sectors where decarbonization is generally considered difficult, net zero by 2050 could be reached at a low cost.For businesses, establishing a net zero target will facilitate more prudent investment. In 2018, the Energy Transitions Commission, which includes businesses such as BP, Shell, Tata and Vattenfall, concluded that even in sectors where decarbonization is generally considered difficult, like aviation, shipping, steel and cement, net zero by 2050 could be reached at a low cost.The ECIU report presents the scientific and political rationale for net zero emissions, outlines types of targets that can be set, and assesses the ways in which net zero emission targets are expected to become more widespread in the coming years.The report shows that more countries are expected to set net zero targets or to put existing targets in legislation in the coming months. The UK is expected to become the largest economy with a legally-binding net zero target, with legislation currently before Parliament. If the UK hosts the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC, for which it is a candidate country, it could make the meeting a “net zero COP” to expand the number of net zero targets and methods of delivering net zero economies.The report was launched on the sidelines of theBonn Climate Change Conferencein June 2019, along withECIU’s online Net Zero Tracker, which presents information on countries, regions, cities and states that have set net zero targets, and countries that are planning to do so.The ECIU is a UK non-profit organization that supports informed debate on energy and climate change issues.

"4 October 2019: The 15th meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC) to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) decided to recommend one widely used industrial chemical for elimination with no exemptions (PFHxS, which is widely used in fire-fighting foams and metal plating, and is also used in commercial household products such as waxes, polishes, and water- and stain-repellent fabrics). POPRC also agreed to commence the second stage of review for two chemicals that were newly proposed for listing (Dechlorane Plus, a polychlorinated flame retardant additive, and Methoxychlor, an organochlorine pesticide).POPRC carries out a range of technical work in support of the Convention’s objective to protect human health and the environment from POPs. TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinnotes that, since entering into force in 2004, the Stockholm Convention has expanded its reach from the original “dirty dozen” chemicals to include 18 new listings and, as the gatekeeper to the Convention, the POPRC has played a critical role in the expansion and success of the Convention in responding to newly identified threats to human health and the environment.The 1-4 October 2019 meeting, which took place in Rome, Italy, brought together a group of 31 government-designated experts (30 of whom were present) plus representatives from government, business and civil society, to review three chemicals nominated for listing in Annexes A, B, and/or C to the Convention: the insecticide methoxychlor; the industrial chemical Dechlorane Plus (and its syn-isomer and anti-isomer); and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), its salts, and related compounds.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreports that POPRC agreed that the first two chemicals, which were in the first phase of the POPRC’s three-stage review process, satisfy the screening criteria (persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport, and adverse effects). Therefore, both methoxychlor and Dechlorane Plus will move to the second stage of the POPRC’s review process, in which the Committee will evaluate a draft risk profile to determine whether the substances meet the specific thresholds necessary for categorization as POPs.On PFHxS, the Committee decided to recommend that the Conference of the Parties (COP) consider listing this substance in Annex A (elimination) with no exemptions.

"20 September 2019: The Government of Portugal has become the 13th country to submit its long-term strategy for low-emission development (LTS) to the UNFCCC Secretariat, highlighting its intent to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Portugal’s LTS titled, ‘Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050 (RCN2050): Long-term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality of the Portuguese Economy by 2050,’ elaborates a path to carbon neutrality, and identifies guidelines for policies and measures required to achieve this goal. It explains that carbon neutrality is economically and technologically feasible and is based on reducing emissions between 85% and 90% by 2050, compared with 2005, and offsetting remaining emissions by ensuring agricultural and forestry carbon sequestration capacity of around 13 million tonnes. The trajectory anticipates emission reductions of between 45-55% by 2030 and between 65%-75% by 2040.RNC2050 also identifies future trends and the necessary social and economic transformations, including: promoting the transition to a competitive, circular, resilient and carbon-neutral economy; contributing to resilience and national capacity to adapt to climate change; stimulating research, innovation and knowledge production in areas required to achieve carbon neutrality; guaranteeing financing conditions and increasing investment levels; ensuring effective conditions for monitoring progress and adopting carbon neutral objectives in different sectors, including energy, transport, trade, services, industry, waste, agriculture and forests; and involving society in addressing climate challenges through education, information and awareness raising, and increasing individual and collective action.Specific actions described in the LTS include:eliminating coal-based power generation by 2030 and achieving full decarbonization of the power generation system by 2050;increasing energy efficiency in all sectors;promoting decarbonization in the residential sector, through urban regeneration, increased energy efficiency in buildings, progressive electrification and combating energy poverty;decarbonizing mobility by,inter alia, strengthening public transport, decarbonizing fleets and reducing the carbon intensity of sea and air transport,expanding conservation and precision agriculture and reducing emissions associated with livestock and fertilizer use;preventing waste generation, increasing recycling rates and reducing waste disposal in landfills;increasing the involvement of cities and local governments, particularly with respect to mobility, buildings, services and waste management;eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies, applying carbon tax, promoting greater taxation of resource use and reducing the tax burden on labor;changing consumption and production patterns, particularly through environmental education and awareness; andpromoting skills development towards new economic opportunities.The LTS also describes the need to continue: strengthening international cooperation on climate action, particularly with Portuguese-speaking countries; defending Europe’s position on climate change; and participating in initiatives aimed at promoting and disseminating good climate action practices.The strategy was developed under the guidance of Portugal’s Ministry of the Environment and Energy Transition, with support from Fundo Ambiental and the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA).Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, all Parties are expected to “strive” to formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low emission development strategies (LEDS) to the UNFCCC Secretariat by 2020.

"The pilot version of the ‘SDGs Audit Model’ offers step-by-step guidance for high-quality audits of national-level efforts to implement the SDGs. The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and its Development Initiative (IDI) released this guidebook for Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs).The guidebook provides practical “how-to” guidance for SAIs in auditing their respective countries’ SDG implementation. The IDI SDGs Audit Model (ISAM) adheres to five principles: focus on outcomes; recognize SAI diversity; base the guidance on International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs); inclusiveness; and add value.For the purposes of the SDGs Audit Model, an audit of SDG implementation is defined as a “performance audit that focuses on the achievement of nationally-agreed targets linked to the SDG targets.” It does not focus on entities, projects, programs, or processes. Instead, it focuses on the interplay between the entities, projects, programs, and processes for the achievement of cross-cutting results. The audit methodology presented in the guidebook focuses on the achievement of outcomes while also encouraging audit institutions to mainstream actions for enhancing impact throughout the audit process.The guidebook includes chapters on how to select topics for audits, how to design an audit of SDG implementation, how to draft a report that has an impact, and how to follow up on the audit. It also includes sections addressing how to audit a government’s efforts related to coherence and integration, multi-stakeholder engagement, efforts to ensure no one is left behind, and policies related to the achievement of a national target.The ISAM encourages SAIs to focus on the “leave no one behind” principle underlying the 2030 Agenda as a key consideration in defining audits of SDG implementation and throughout the audit process.The English version of the ISAM was launched on 31 March 2020. It is currently available in English and Spanish. It will be translated into Arabic and French prior to June 2020. The ISAM will be updated based on lessons learned during pilot audits and other feedback.

"The UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities warned against measures that aim to fight the COVID-19 pandemic but are impossible for people with disabilities, thus leaving them behind. SDG target 8.5 calls for achieving full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities. The 2030 Agenda also stresses that “people who are vulnerable must be empowered. Those whose needs are reflected in the Agenda include … persons with disabilities (of whom more than 80% live in poverty).”People with disabilities need additional guidance and support for protection during the pandemic, and this may not be possible with total self-isolation and social distancing. Catalina Devandas, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, pointed out that some rely on others for basic survival needs, including to eat, dress, and bathe. Some services that are essential for people with disabilities may be suspended, and they may not be able to afford home deliveries, stockpiles of medicine and food, and other measures.Among her suggestions:Allow people with disabilities to work from home, or provide paid leave;Allow family members and caregivers to support people with disabilities;Provide financial aid to prevent greater vulnerability or poverty for people with disabilities and their families;Ensure people with disabilities in institutions, psychiatric facilities and prisons can continue having contact with loved ones, to prevent abuse or neglect in the institutions; andMake information on preventing and containing coronavirus accessible to everyone, including by providing them in sign language and other accessible means, modes and formats (e.g. captioning).The UN expert urged States to establish clear protocols to ensure that access to health care does not discriminate against people with disabilities.The Special Rapporteur is an independent, voluntary expert for the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).

"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has announced a four-city pilot of a project to make plastic waste management more “circular” and reduce plastic pollution of the marine environment.Southeast Asia is the world’s “most polluting region” for ocean plastics, as noted by ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. The region’s fast-growing cities, in particular, contribute approximately 60% of plastic waste leakage into the environment. The pollution originates from uncollected waste and leakages in municipal waste management systems.Local governments will use digital tools to identify waste generation “hot spots.”Launched on 5 May 2020, the ‘Closing the Loop’ project, which is supported by the Government of Japan, will help to build the capacity of ASEAN cities to plan for and manage their plastic waste using circular economy principles. The pilot cities are: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Surabaya, Indonesia; Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand and Da Nang, Viet Nam.First, a digital tool will help local governments monitor plastic waste leakage and identify “hot spots” for waste generation. The tool will use remote sensing, satellite and crowdsourced data applications to produce plastic waste maps and simulations.Second, the project will provide training and tools for policymakers to develop policy and investment strategies that apply a “circular economy” approach in managing their plastic waste streams.The project will support local implementation of two intergovernmental frameworks: theASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris; and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, which was introduced during Japan’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) in 2019. The Osaka Vision is acommitmentby G20 leaders to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050.The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and other partners will collaborate with ESCAP and Japan to implement the project with local and national governments in Southeast Asia. [ESCAP press release] [Project webpage]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Indonesia has launched a project that will help small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remove lead in paint production processes and support the establishment of lead paint regulations. The project is expected to result in a National Indonesian Standard for paint products and a ban on using pigments that use heavy metals to protect domestic consumers.Under the project, theInternational Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), together with theNexus3 Foundation, will work with Indonesia to establish a standard of no more than 90 ppm of lead in all types of paints, including decorative, architectural, and industrial paints. This standard is recommended under theModel Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paintthat was developed by theGlobal Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint.More than 60 representatives from government, industry, and civil society participated in aJanuary 2020 workshoplaunching the project. Workshop participants addressed data and information on health and economic impacts, lead paint testing in Indonesia, current regulations, and the paint market situation. In addition, participants heard about work plans for SMEs and possible SME candidates, suggestions on ways to improve current lead paint limits, and a simplified version of the technical guidelines for eliminating lead in paint elimination.Indonesia is the largest paint and coating market in Southeast Asia, with the property sector being the primary growth driver of Indonesia’s paint and coating industry. Although many manufacturers have reformulated their paint products to avoid lead, the economic costs of childhood lead exposure in Indonesia is estimated at USD 37.9 billion, and four million children under the age of five are at risk.Indonesia has limited policies and regulations restricting the production and use of lead-based paints, although the government has enacted a voluntary national standard addressing soluble lead content in decorative paint for various uses. In addition, many domestic paint manufacturers have not complied with international standards, and some intentionally lower their quality and use cheap and dangerous raw materials to offer lower prices to the market.The initiative is part of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) project on global best practices for phasing out lead paint funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

"10 October 2019: A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cautions that obesity-related diseases will claim more than 90 million lives in OECD countries over the next 30 years, reducing life expectancy by nearly three years. The publication notes that the disease will also reduce gross domestic product (GDP) by 3.3% in OECD countries and impact personal budgets through additional expenses as high as USD 360 per capita per year.Launched on 10 October 2019, the report titled, ‘The Heavy Burden of Obesity – The Economics of Prevention,’ uses microsimulation modelling to analyze obesity and overweight in 52 countries (including OECD, EU and G20 countries). The publication makes an economic case for urgently scaling up investments in policies to promote healthy lifestyles and tackle the growing global public health problem of obesity. The report also proposes a number of policies that could improve health outcomes while being a good investment for countries.According to the authors, more than 50% of the population is currently overweight in 34 out of 36 OECD countries, and almost one in four people is obese, with average rates of adult obesity in OECD countries having increased from 21% in 2010 to 24% in 2016. OECD countries already spend 8.4% of their total health budget on treating obesity-related diseases: a total of USD 311 billion, or USD 209 per capita, per year. The publication highlights that obesity is responsible for 70% of treatment costs for diabetes, 23% for cardiovascular diseases and 9% for cancers.The report notes that children who are overweight do less well at school and are more likely to miss school and to complete higher education. They also show lower life satisfaction.The authors report that obese adults are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, as well as reduced life expectancy. In the EU, the publication finds that women and men in the lowest income group are respectively 90% and 50% more likely to be obese compared to those with the highest incomes, entrenching inequality. People suffering from at least one chronic disease associated with being overweight are 8% less likely to be employed the following year and, when they have a job, they are 3.4% more likely to be absent or less productive.According to the report, every dollar invested in preventing obesity would generate an economic return of up to six dollars. Solutions could include: food and menu labelling; prescription of physical activity by primary care doctors; workplace wellness programmes; increased access to active public transport; promotion of physical activity in schools; regulation of advertising of unhealthy food to children; and food reformulation.

"3 July 2019: A group of stakeholders launched the ‘Business for Nature’ coalition, which aims to provide a united business voice at the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020. According to the launching announcement, the coalition aims to “clearly demonstrate” that the protection of nature is “an economic as well as a moral imperative,” and to call on governments to adopt “an ambitious new deal for nature and people” in 2020 to protect and enhance the natural world, supported by specific sets of actions.Specifically, the coalition aims to demonstrate the existing scale of business actions to protect nature by: uniting, amplifying, and helping to scale existing business commitment platforms; driving the global narrative around the economic importance of “a thriving natural world”; and showcasing business solutions that translate commitments into actions for meaningful impact.On the occasion of the launch, Paul Polman, Chair, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), expressed his excitement about the coalition’s potential to bring business leaders together to act and advocate for nature. Noting that our entire economy “is a subsidiary of nature,” he stressed the need for business to come together “now, as we did for the Paris Climate Summit, to ensure that we collectively protect that which makes our very existence possible.” Thomas Lingard, Unilever, said the ‘Business for Nature’ coalition creates an opportunity for businesses to work together to demonstrate how protecting nature is at the heart of building “truly sustainable economies and livelihoods.”The coalition partners include: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), We Mean Business, the World Economic Forum (WEF), WWF, ICC, the Natural Capital Coalition, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Entreprises pour l’Environnement, the World Resources Institute (WRI), the Confederation of Indian Industry, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Food and Land Use Coalition and the Tropical Forest Alliance.Alongside listing a number of nature commitment platforms where businesses can make pledges, the coalition’s website also suggests ways through which business can “already start delivering for nature” by:Working through their own operations and value chainsto identify, reduce, and avoid impacts, while also identifying dependencies, nature-based solutions, and other opportunities that create benefits for nature and people;Leading landscape-level collaborationin landscapes, river basins and seascapes to ensure ecosystem conservation and restoration, and the supply of ecosystem services delivered by nature to society and the economy;Implementing systemic change to organizations and business modelsby identifying impacts and dependencies on natural capital and taking nature into account when making decisions, disclosing and reporting; andRecommending and promoting policy changesto governments to establish the policy frameworks needed to drive economic changes as scale.The coalition was launched during the ninth Trondheim Conference on Biodiversity, which took place from 2-5 July 2019 in Trondheim, Norway.

"17 July 2019: A World Resources Institute (WRI) publication proposes a five-course ‘menu of solutions’ to ensure food security for 10 billion people by 2050 without increasing emissions, fueling deforestation or exacerbating poverty. The report underscores that the global food system must undergo “urgent change” to ensure adequate food for everyone without destroying the environment.‘The World Resources Report: Creating a Sustainable Food Future’ was produced by WRI in partnership with the World Bank, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Development Programme (UNDP), and France’s Agricultural Research for Development (CIRAD) and National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). Many of the report’s findings use the new GlobAgri-WRR model, which quantifies how much every proposed “menu item” can help increase the availability of food, avoid deforestation, and reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. The publication also identifies policies, innovations, and incentives that can take the proposed solutions to scale.The report highlights three gaps that need to be closed to achieve sustainable food systems: a 56% “food gap” between what was produced in 2010 and food that will be needed in 2050; a nearly 600 million-hectare “land gap” (an area nearly twice the size of India) between global agricultural land area in 2010 and expected agricultural expansion by 2050; and an 11-gigaton “GHGs mitigation gap” between expected emissions from agriculture in 2050 and the level needed to meet the Paris Agreement.To close these gaps, the publication calls for major adjustments in the production of food and in people’s consumption, and gives policymakers, businesses, and researchers a roadmap for measures spanning wild fisheries management to beef consumption. The report explores a 22-item “menu for a sustainable food future,” which is divided into “five courses” that together could close the three identified gaps.They include: (1) Reduce growth in demand by cutting food loss and waste, eating healthier diets, and more; (2) Increase food production without expanding agricultural land area via yield gains for both crops and livestock; (3) Protect and restore natural ecosystems by reducing deforestation, restoring peatlands, and linking yield gains with ecosystem conservation; (4) Increase fish supply by improving aquaculture systems and better managing wild fisheries; and (4) Reduce GHGs emissions from agricultural production through innovative technologies and farming methods.The report argues that shifting consumption patterns, increasing the productivity of crops and livestock, and improving the efficiency of inputs like fertilizers could significantly reduce emissions and the demand for land while raising agricultural incomes. In addition, the text notes that maintaining global warming below a 1.5°C increase above pre-industrial levels would require reforesting more than 585 million hectares made available by these demand- and supply-side efficiency gains.

"25 September 2019: The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, launched the Coalition for Disaster-Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in New York, US. The fledgling partnership has a secretariat in Delhi, supported by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), to enable knowledge exchange, technical support and capacity building.CDRI’s mission is to rapidly expand the development of resilient infrastructure and retrofit existing infrastructure for resilience, and to enable a measurable reduction in infrastructure losses. Its mission statement notes that, in recent weather and climate-related disasters, up to 66% of public sector losses were related to infrastructure damage. The partnership will be working in the areas of governance and policy, emerging technology, risk identification and estimation, recovery and reconstruction, resilience standards and certification, finance, and capacity development.CDRI is bringing together developed and developing countries to build synergies to reach the goal of disaster-resilient infrastructure.Mami Mizutori, UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), welcomed the initiative, emphasizing the need to “get the built environment right,” given the rise in extreme weather events and the rapid pace of urbanization around the world. Mizutori highlighted the benefits to be gained from joining CDRI, emphasizing that ensuring resilient infrastructure will be one of the most important actions for protecting lives and livelihoods. The World Bank and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) expressed support for CDRI and committed to working closely with its secretariat in Delhi.SDG target 9.1 commits to developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure, while target 9.a seeks to facilitate its development in developing States through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). UNDRR estimates that around USD 94 trillion will be needed for infrastructure investment in the next 20 years and that 60% of this investment will take place in developing countries.There are 12 founding members of CDRI: Australia, Bhutan, Fiji, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Maldives, Mexico, Mongolia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka and the UK. Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Environment and Climate Change, India, called on all concerned to collaborate on the initiative, which, he stressed, is bringing together developed and developing countries, SIDS, and LLDCs to build synergies to reach the goal of disaster-resilient infrastructure.The formation of the Coalition is the result of efforts by India and UNDRR, responding to Modi’s call at theAsian Ministerial Conference on DRRfor action to reduce damage to critical infrastructure. India and UNDRR, with the World Bank, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Commission on Adaptation, have hosted two international workshops on disaster-resilient infrastructure in2018and 2019, respectively. The partners have also held consultations with more than 35 countries that represent a variety of challenges posed by development, climate, and disaster risk factors.

"Climate change, changing business models, and geopolitical tension are threatening to slow economic growth around the world – and lower living standards – in the coming years, according to the 2019 Economic Outlook from the Organisation for Co-operation and Development (OECD). By the end of 2019, the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to be at its lowest rate since 2008 financial crisis, and to remain at that level in 2020 and 2021.The OECD publication reports that aggregate investment growth in the countries in the Group of 20 (G20), excluding China, slowed from an annual rate of 5% in the beginning 2018 to 1% in the first half of 2019. In the US, growth is forecasted to slow to 2% in 2020 and 2021, and to around 1% in the Euro area and Japan. China is expected to decelerate from 6.6% to 5.5% in 2021. If governments do not take action to address the structural causes of this slow-down, the international community is heading towards a future of declining living standards, warned OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría.The 2019 Outlook identifies these structural causes:two years of escalating conflict over tariffs, principally between the US and China;uncertainty about a future EU-UK trade relationship;the high level of corporate debt;the transformation of the business models by digitalization; andthe disruption caused to existing patterns of activity by climate and demographic changes.To address these structural issues, OECD highlights that policymaking “must lead” the transition to cleaner energy and to an increasingly digital world. It calls on governments to work together “urgently” to establish fair international rules on taxation and trade, and boost investment.

It seeks to improve regional coordination and share climate change information, traditional knowledge and solutions.As the regional Centre of Excellence, the PCCC will act as a hub for climate change information, research and innovation, and provide practical tools, knowledge, support and training to address adaptation and mitigation priorities of Pacific islanders.The Government of New Zealand will provide financial support for staff positions, including the PCCC Manager, a readiness adviser to help SPREP Members access climate change finance, and technical advisers to coordinate knowledge management and apply science to address challenges. Going forward, Japan will provide a technical advisory training programme on adaptation and mitigation.Climate change practitioners from the Pacific put forward the idea of a regional climate change center ten years ago during the Pacific Climate Change Roundtable in Majuro, the Marshall Islands. In 2012, the SPREP Secretariat proposed, and countries agreed, to request support from Japan through the Samoan Government to construct the PCCC at SPREP headquarters. In 2015, the Government of Japan accepted the request from SPREP and the Government of Samoa to build the Centre.The PCCC’s construction cost approximately USD 8 million, and was undertaken by Japanese and Samoan construction companies. It will get 50% of its energy needs from solar panels, and use energy and water saving technologies. The PCCC aims to run on 100% renewable energy in the future.

"After its launch during the high-level week of the 74th UN General Assembly (UNGA), Local2030 Islands, a platform to accelerate island-led SDG implementation, is starting to operationalize its partnership.The initiative was launched at UN Headquarters on 27 September 2019, on the margins of the UNGA’s High-level Review of the Samoa Pathway. Local2030 Islands was launched by the Global Island Partnership (GLISPA) in partnership with the governments of Belize, Curacao, Grenada, Hawai’i, Ireland, Marshall Islands and Seychelles, as well as Hawai’i Green Growth, Guam, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN-Habitat and the UN Foundation. It is part of the UN Local2030 Partnership.The Local2030 Islands initiative is committed to four principles:Identify local goals to advance the SDGs and strengthen long-term political leadership on sustainable development and climate resilience;Strengthen public-private partnerships that support diverse stakeholders in integrating sustainability priorities into policy and planning;Measure SDG progress through tracking and reporting on locally and culturally informed indicators; andImplement concrete initiatives that build island resilience and a circular economy through locally appropriate solutions, particularly at the water-energy-food nexus.After the launch, the founding partners began operationalizing the partnership. They are working to establish an interim steering committee that will further develop and finalize the role, governance and activities of the network, including a detailed vision for the network, its membership and decision-making framework, and the scope of activities and a plan for 2020.Local2030 Islands also aims to broaden its membership to other island jurisdictions and cooperating institutions.

"The World Bank has published a report analyzing options to enhance the transformative and catalytic impact of public climate finance by addressing systemic barriers to low-carbon and climate-resilient investments.Titled, ‘Transformative Climate Finance: A New Approach for Climate Finance to Achieve Low-carbon Resilient Development in Developing Countries,’ the report identifies eight sets of climate levers to drive climate action: project-based investments; financial sector reform; fiscal policy; sector policies; trade policy; innovation; carbon markets; and climate intelligence. The publication recommends best practices to maximize the transformative impact of climate finance on developing countries seeking to achieve clean development targets.Commenting on the report, Marc Sadler, World Bank, highlighted the role of the “increased realization of economic benefits from clean development pathways” in making climate finance spending more catalytic. With strategic allocation of climate finance, he said, the eight sets of climate levers identified in the report can “unlock greater value for money and help countries build back better.”In order to achieve transformative results, the report notes, limited public funding for climate action must leverage significantly more funding from other sources. The report proposes the following recommendations to realize this goal:Enhance leverage on a wider, systemic basis: public climate finance should be allocated to projects which maximize leverage from the private sector and governments. The scope and impact should extend beyond the project, achieving results on an economy-wide scale.Make use of a wider variety of financial instruments: climate finance, which currently relies predominantly on grants and loans for project-level interventions, should be extended to include policy-based finance, results-based finance, equity finance, and guarantees.Long-term planning: finance should be aligned with recipient countries’ long-term strategies for low-carbon, climate-resilient development.Invest in climate intelligence: low-cost tools have a significant leveraging effect by demonstrating the benefits of climate action and providing the knowledge for its implementation. Such tools include climate impact and vulnerability maps, models for long-term scenario simulation and planning, early warning technologies, and physical and transitional risk assessment tools.The World Bank Climate Change Group published the report as part of itsKickstarting the Sustainable Recovery Seriesin partnership withInnovate4Climateto demonstrate ways in which sustainable finance can contribute to COVID-19 recovery efforts.

"In a report on connectivity in Africa, the Broadband for All Working Group offers a strategy for achieving SDG target 9.c (Significantly increase access to information communication technologies (ICTs) and strive to provide universal and affordable access to internet in least developed countries (LDCs) by 2020).The authors note that significant progress has been made towards this target, particularly in Asia. However, in Africa, where most of the LDCs are located, the 2020 target is expected to be missed on the dimensions of both access and affordability. Less than a third of the population in Africa has access to broadband connectivity.The report titled, ‘Connecting Africa Through Broadband: A strategy for doubling connectivity by 2021 and reaching universal access by 2030,’ was published during the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group, whichtook placefrom 14-20 October 2019, in Washington, DC, US.According to the publication, achieving universal, affordable and good quality internet access across Africa by 2030 will require bringing about 1.1 billion more people online and an investment of USD100 billion. The authors note that the lack of access to reliable and affordable electricity and other challenges that slow broadband penetration will require “exceptional and coordinated” efforts from governments, the private sector, development partners and civil society. Connecting the 100 million people in rural and remote areas that live out of reach of traditional cellular mobile networks, the report finds, will require “strong private sector involvement, innovative business models, and alternative technologies,” such as satellite and Wi-Fi based technical solutions.The report provides practical insights and suggestions on achieving SDG target 9.c, including an action plan for universal broadband connectivity in Africa. The action plans calls to:Ensure that the commercial broadband market is open and structurally prepared for competitive private investment;Provide public/donor funding support for larger, high-cost infrastructure investments to reduce risk and increase commercial viability;Provide direct funding support for extending affordable broadband access to commercially challenging rural and remote areas, and to women and low-income users under a “Mobilizing Finance for Development” approach;Reduce non-economic costs and risks of market entry and investment;Expand the market through government procurement and implementation of broadband-based digital services, networks and facilities; andEnsuring that the technical skills needed to operate and maintain digital infrastructure are increasingly available in the region.The Working Group on Broadband for All: A Digital Moonshot Infrastructure for Africa, led by the World Bank, was established in 2018 under the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development to identify investment requirements and policy roadmaps for increase connectivity and reaching full coverage in Africa.The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development was established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and includes CEOs and industry leaders, senior policy-makers and government representatives, international agencies, academia and organizations concerned with development.

"On Wednesday, 21 March 2018, organizations from the United Nations system, most active in addressing the global e-waste challenge, signed a Letter of Intent paving the way for coordination and collaboration on United Nations system-wide support for e-waste management.The signatories included: UN Environment, the International Telecommunication Union, United Nations University, International Labour Organization, the Basel and Stockholm Conventions, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.The transition towards a more digital, information, and knowledge society offers unprecedented opportunities for sustainable development. However, with the emergence of such a society arises the growth of the global consumption of electrical and electronic equipment that leads to a global challenge in electronic waste. The signing of the Letter of Intent contributes to the ongoing work of the Environment Management Group, which is currently coordinating United Nations organizations to promote system-wide action and collaboration in the area of e-waste.Two major reports on the global e-waste situation and the United Nations’ efforts to address the e-waste challenge were released at the end of 2017. On one hand, the Environment Management Group report on theUnited Nations System-wide Response to Tackling E-wastehighlighted the need for strengthened collaboration among United Nations organizations, with over 20 organizations active in tackling e-waste. It also presented over 150 e-waste initiatives that have been undertaken since 2004. On the other hand, theGlobal E-waste Monitor, developed by the International Telecommunication Union, United Nations University and International Solid Waste Association, has highlighted the increasing generation of e-waste and noted that in 2016 some 44.7 million metric tonnes of e-waste were generated globally.The Letter of Intent paves the way for a coordinated effort across United Nations organizations in addressing the challenge of e-waste. Some of the envisaged plans may include negotiations towards an e-waste coalition, more engagement with electronics manufacturers and recyclers, pilot projects to address downstream e-waste management activities and consumer behavior, and partnering with interested private sector entities to develop a knowledge sharing platform to host information on United Nations e-waste projects, and global statistics and data relating to e-products and e-waste.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"3 July 2019: A publication by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that over half of developing countries surveyed have made progress in diversifying their economies since the 2006 launch of the Aid for Trade Initiative by the OECD and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Diversification helps to economically empower marginalized groups, the authors note.The report titled, ‘Aid for Trade at a Glance 2019: Economic Diversification and Empowerment,’ shares the findings of a survey of 88 developing countries. Most of the progress registered in 2019 was in the agricultural sector, followed by services and industry. The publication finds that every USD invested in aid for trade has generated USD 8 worth of exports in developing countries and nearly USD 20 of exports in LDCs, depending on the country and the type of investment. Even though many developing countries still face supply-side constraints, the report notes that open, rules-based trading contributes to global welfare by helping to diffuse goods, services, technology and knowledge. The authors emphasize that empowering small business, youth and women to participate in and benefit from trade is key for achieving the SDGs.The report also notes that the progress to date is geographically uneven, and the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), landlocked developing countries (LDCs) and countries affected by conflict still face difficulties in using international commerce to diversify their economies.Aid for trade is found to support countries’ ability to eventually graduate from LDC status. Although in the past 30 years only five countries have graduated from LDC status, two more are expected to do so in 2020-2021 (Vanuatu and Angola) and ten others, the text says, are moving in the same direction at a good pace. The remaining 35 LDCs show little progress towards readiness to graduate.Moving forward, the publication calls for paying greater attention to the social and environmental impact of economic diversification through:better incentive frameworks to attract more and better private investments;targeted social policies to support the reallocation of resources;government interventions that address market, policy, and institutional failures; andpolicy reforms targeted at reducing trade costs, coupled with better access to infrastructure and health.In his remarks on the report launch, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurríaobservedthat “rising trade tensions and protectionism are hurting growth prospects and any shift away from rules-based trade hits the most vulnerable countries and people hardest.” [OECD Press Release] [Publication:Aid for Trade at a Glance 2019: Economic Diversification and Empowerment]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"5 September 2019: The Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Executive Secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have announced the theme for2020 Biodiversity Conference. The theme is rooted in the Chinese vision of an ecological civilization and draws inspiration from traditional and new eco-innovations.The meeting’s theme, ‘Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth,’ was announced on 5 September 2019, at a special press conference between Li Ganjie, Minister of Ecology and Environment of China, and Cristiana Paşca Palmer, CBD Executive Secretary. The Conference, which will take place in October 2020 in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China, will review the achievement of the CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. Country Parties are also expected to take a final decision on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.Nature is the fundamental infrastructure supporting life on earth.Speaking at the press conference, the high level officials mentioned that the theme aims to inspire a global society in which economic, social, cultural and environmental concerns are addressed “in a truly holistic way, by recognizing that nature is the fundamental infrastructure supporting life on earth.”Li mentioned that the chosen theme reaffirms China’s political commitment and encourages the international community to protect biodiversity and accelerate actions on the existing global biodiversity targets, while guiding the direction of the 2020 negotiations. Paşca Palmer added that the Conference will represent “a historic opportunity” for the international community to set a new course that enables humanity to reconcile its relationship with nature by recognizing its dependence on the good functioning of natural systems.Negotiations for the 2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the Conference started during the first session of the CBD Open-Ended-Working Group, which was held from 27-30 August, in Nairobi, Kenya. The next rounds of negotiations are scheduled for February 2020, in Kunming, China, and in Colombia in July 2020.The 2020 Biodiversity Conference will also serve as the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD, the tenth Meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol COP/MOP 10) and the fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (Nagoya Protocol COP/MOP 4) [CBD Press Release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
"28 June 2019: The co-chairs of the of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on a global pact for the environment have forwarded the Working Group’s recommendations to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). The Group, established by the UNGA in 2018, held a series of meetings to consider possible gaps in international environmental law (IEL) and environment-related instruments with a view to strengthening their implementation. The resulting recommendations were agreed on 23 May 2019, and do not include the creation of a new international instrument.UNGA resolution 72/277 (‘Towards a Global Pact for the Environment’) established the Working Group, following which three substantive sessions convened in Nairobi, Kenya, in January, March and May 2019. The outcome is contained in document A/AC.289/6/Rev.1.Rather than calling for creation of a new IEL instrument, the Working Group recommends that the UNGA,inter alia:Encourage UN Member States and all members of the specialized agencies to strengthen, “where needed,” environmental laws, policies and regulatory frameworks at the national level, as well as capacities across all sectors for effective IEL implementation, including in the administrative and justice sectors, in accordance with national legal systems;Encourage UN Member States and all members of the specialized agencies to mainstream environment into sectoral policies and programmes at all levels, including into national development and sustainable development plans;Encourage the “active and meaningful engagement” of all relevant stakeholders at all levels in the different forums related to the implementation of IEL and environment-related instruments; andEncourage the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), as chair of the Environment Management Group, to continue to strengthen system-wide inter-agency coordination on the environment, and to call for the implementation of system-wide strategies on the environment.The Working Group’s outcome notes that upon adoption of the resolutions, many Member States made statements in explanation of position with respect to the recommendations. Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), the EU and the US specifically requested that their statements be reflected in the report. G-77/China expressed regret that the recommendation on means of implementation does not acknowledge “in any meaningful manner the requisite balance between action and support.” They called for increases in means of implementation from all sources, “in the name of equity.” The US emphasized that the agreed language on means of implementation does not imply a call for increased support from any particular country, and noted the need for “an expanded pool of donors beyond traditional donors.” The EU said the Working Group’s recommendations do not prejudge further discussions with regard to the provision of means of implementation and existing commitments.On the way forward, the Working Group recommends that the UNGA forward its recommendations to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) for consideration, and for UNEA to prepare, at its fifth session in February 2021 (UNEA-5), a political declaration for a UN high-level meeting, subject to voluntary funding, in the context of commemoration of UNEP’s creation in 1972, with a view to strengthening the implementation of IEL.

"The Global Water Partnership (GWP) has launched an inter-agency effort to promote the resilience of water resources worldwide in the face of climate change. Over the next year, the initiative, called Water Resilience Frontiers, will work with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other partners to support the integration of water considerations into country revisions of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and development planning.The work will maximize the application of ‘frontier technologies’ and social practices, including digital technologies, sustainability practices, futures forecasting and art projects.GWPlaunchedthe initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, in December 2019, emphasizing that, while water is already on the climate agenda, it needs to be brought from the margins to the mainstream. The initiative, referred to in full as ‘Water Resilience Frontiers: Pathways for Transformational Climate Resilient Water Security in 2030 and Beyond’, will harness the best and latest thinking and actions to support preparations for climate-induced water scarcity. The initiative is part of the UNFCCC’s Nairobi Work Programme, which supports adaptation policies and practices.GWP also launched several publications at Climate Change Conference, including astudyof 15 countries’ integration of water action in their NDCs, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and SDG strategies.“Nowhere is there real integration” in water resource management, and transboundary management is “dramatically absent.”Monika Weber-Fahr, GWP Executive Secretary,statedthat the findings show “nowhere is there real integration” in water resource management, and that transboundary management is “dramatically absent.” She called for leadership on water issues, which, she said, could bring together the climate and sustainable development agendas. She alsourgedministerial-level delegates from all countries to identify and act on vulnerable ecosystems so as to avoid having “water points of no return” such as the Aral Sea and Lake Chad, where environmental collapse has occurred despite prior awareness of mismanagement.Alex Simalabwi, Global Head, GWP, stressed that water availability will change in years to come, and that planning and investment, supported by laws and policies, should begin immediately.GWP has worked with partners in more than 60 countries to improve their resilience to climate change through offering guidance on water-related investments.

"15 July 2019: The UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF) held its in-depth review of SDG 17 on means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda. The session marked the completion of the series of reviews of six SDGs selected for 2019: Goals 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 10 (reduced inequalities), 13 (climate action), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and 17. SDG 17 is the only Goal reviewed every year.SDG 17 calls to strengthen the means of implementation for realizing sustainable development, and to revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. It contains19 targets– the most of any SDG – that are divided into five categories: finance; technologies; capacity building; trade; and systemic issues. “Systemic issues” is divided further into targets that address: policy and institutional coherence; multi-stakeholder partnerships; and data, monitoring and accountability.The session to review progress against SDG 17 during the 2019 HLPF was titled, ‘Financing the SDGs: Moving from Words to Action (From the FfD Forum to the High-level Dialogue).’ The title refers to the 2019 session of the UN Economic and Social Council’s Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum) that took place in April 2019, and the UN General Assembly’s upcominghigh-level dialogueon FfD, which will convene in September 2019.Yongyi Min, UN Statistics Division, provided a “statistical snapshot” of SDG 17 to inform participants’ discussion. According to theEarth Negotiations Bulletin, she said official development assistance (ODA) was down in 2018 by 2.7% in real terms from 2017, and humanitarian aid fell by 8%. She also noted a reduction in aid to the least developed countries (LDCs) and African countries, who need it most, saying donor countries are not living up to the pledge to scale up ODA.Among other expert inputs to the meeting, Homi Kharas, Brookings Institution, said:Most investment in the SDGs has taken place in high- and middle-income countries;There is a gap of USD 840 billion per year to implement the SDGs; andThe poor should not be overtaxed to implement the SDGs through domestic resource mobilization.Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank Group, suggested reducing the cost of remittances, focusing on fragile and post-conflict states, and mobilizing women entrepreneurs.In interventions from Member States, South Africa said SDG implementation should not result in increasing indebtedness. Ghana and Nigeria said multinational corporations working in developing countries should pay taxes. Kenya called for establishing an intergovernmental body to work on global norms for taxation.Canada stressed the role of inclusive partnerships in implementing the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on FfD. While Denmark said unlocking private sector funds requires turning development challenges into bankable projects, South Africa pointed to the importance of ODA for de-risking and improving bankability of projects.The UNGA’s High-level Dialogue on FfD will take place on 26 September 2019, as part of the high-level week of the UNGA’s 74th session.The other in-depth reviews during 2019 HLPF focused onSDG 4,SDG 8,SDG 10,SDG 13andSDG 16.

"11 July 2019: A side event exploring the critical role of water in the realization of the SDGs under review at the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) highlighted how reliable water supplies help to achieve a number of SDGs, including: productivity and job security (SDG 8); reduced poverty (SDG 1); human rights, peace and justice (SDG 16); and reduced inequality, especially for marginalized and poor populations, women, and those affected by migration and conflict (SDGs 5 and 10).The event titled, ‘Water, Crucial to Achieve the SDGs Under Review at the HLPF 2019,’ raised concern about growing disparities in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) access, quality, and affordability within and across countries, noting that billions are “being left behind.” Speakers highlighted the rise of social and economic instability linked to climate change, noting, for example, that 32% of Africa’s population is projected to be water-stressed by 2025.Shamila Nair-Bedouelle, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), highlighted linkages between SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 4 (quality education), noting that access to adequate WASH and Menstrual Hygiene Management infrastructure reduces absenteeism of both educators and students, minimizes the transmission of diseases, and favors inclusion and dignity, improving enrollment and educational outcomes. She also stressed that WASH is critical for a productive and healthy workforce (SDGs 3 on good health and well-being and 8).During a panel discussion on best practices for accelerating integrated action between SDG 6 and other Goals at the regional and country level, speakers stressed the need to break silos of water management and improve data management on water and sanitation, especially in the developing world. The discussions also highlighted the role of water as an instrument for peace, and called for greater attention to water diplomacy as a strategy to promote collaborative approaches.The event was co-organized by Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), South Africa, UN Water, UNESCO and the Global Water Partnership (GWP).IISD Reporting Services is providing coverage ofselected side eventsduring the 2019 HLPF.

"After seven years in office, World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo has announced that he will step down on 31 August 2020, cutting his second term short by one year. The timing of Azevêdo’s departure from the Organization is intended to give his successor the time to work with WTO members to shape the strategic direction for the Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) and beyond.Azevêdo made the announcement at a virtual meeting of all WTO members on 14 May, ahead of the special virtual meeting of the General Council on 15 May.In astatement, Azevêdo highlighted the need to “ensure that trade contributes to the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic” and to advance the wider discussions around WTO reform to ensure that the Organization continues to be able to respond to members’ needs and priorities. In this regard, he identifiedMC12as “a critical landmark” and “a stepping-stone to the future of the WTO.” Azevêdo indicated that the high-level Conference, originally scheduled to take place from 8-11 June 2020, in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, may take place in the middle or at the end of 2021.The WTO must start 2021 with a focus on the real challenges such as ensuring that the multilateral trading system responds to new economic realities.Azevêdo stated that staying on through the end of his term could cause the “politically charged” selection process for the next Director-General to “impair preparatory work for MC12,” and called for “decoupling” these two processes. Urging members to “promptly move ahead with the process for selecting the next Director-General,” he said the WTO must start 2021 with a focus on the “real challenges” such as “ensuring that the multilateral trading system responds to new economic realities,” particularly the post-COVID-19 recovery. With physical meetings suspended due to the pandemic, Azevêdo encouraged members to “launch the selection process with less impact than usual on our work.”According to theprocedures for the Director-General selection process, adopted by WTO members in 2002, in the event of a vacancy, “the Chair of the General Council shall initiate, as soon as possible, a process for appointment of a new Director-General.” Responding to Azevêdo’s statement, Chair of the General Council, David Walker, indicated his intention to “immediately engage with members” and initiate this process by sending a communication to notify all members of its start. Walker said he will also consult with members to “look at establishing expedited deadlines as necessary, given the very limited time that we have before 1 September.”If no new Director-General is selected by 1 September, pursuant to the 2002 procedures, the General Council “shall designate one of the existing Deputy Directors-General to serve as Acting Director-General until the appointment of a new Director-General.” The four Deputy Directors-General are Yonov Frederick Agah (Nigeria), Karl Brauner (Germany), Alan Wolff (US), and Yi Xiaozhun (China).Roberto Azevêdo (Brazil) is the sixth Director-General of the WTO. He assumed office on 1 September 2013, serving a four-year term. His second four-year term as WTO Director-General started on 1 September 2017. [WTO News Release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"21 October 2019: A new guide by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) titled, ‘Advancing the Forest and Water Nexus: A capacity development facilitation guide,’ highlights the role of forests in achieving clean water for all as well as other SDGs.The guide features six modules: introducing forest-water relationships; understanding the impact of changing landscapes on water; measuring and monitoring forest-water relationships; monitoring for forests and water; the forest-water nexus in action; and measuring the benefits of the forest-water nexus.The guide states that 90% of the world’s cities depend on forested watersheds for their water supply, and forested watersheds provide 75% of the world’s accessible freshwater resources. Yet, only 25% of global forest management schemes integrate forest, water and soil conservation. The publication, therefore, argues for an integrated approach to forest and water management. It calls for improving policymakers ability to design, implement and learn from forest-water landscape approaches.The guide highlights that improved management of forests to account for the provision of water-related ecosystem services is critical to the achievement of at least nine of the 17 SDGs. For instance, the sound management of forests (SDG 15) can contribute to improved access to water (SDG 6) and reduce the time it takes women and girls to collect water, contributing to SDG 5 (gender equality). Per the text, the forest-water nexus also has a direct impact on SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 2 (zero hunger) and an indirect link to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).  [FAO Press Release] [Publication:Advancing the Forest and Water Nexus]",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
"Capping a year that wasone of the three warmest on record, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) released its fifth Adaptation Gap Report, finding that although many nations have advanced in adaptation planning, developing countries face a significant gap in adaptation finance.The importance of national-level adaptation planning processes, the report notes, is reflected in the the Paris Agreement on climate change, which commits all countries to report on progress. According to the publication, 72% of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, and most developing countries are now preparing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). However,as in previous years, the pace at which public and private adaptation finance is increasing is being outpaced by increasing adaptation costs. The report estimates that developing countries currently face USD 70 billion in adaptation costs, a number expected to rise to USD 140 billion – 300 billion by 2030 and USD 280 billion – 500 billion by 2050.Among “encouraging” developments, the report mentions that theGreen Climate Fund(GCF) has allocated 40% of its total portfolio to adaptation and is increasingly crowding-in private sector investment. Additionally, the implementation of adaptation projects is advancing. Almost 400 adaptation projects financed by multilateral funds serving the Paris Agreement have taken place in developing countries since 2006. While earlier projects rarely exceeded USD 10 million in value, since 2017, 21 projects have been valued more than USD 25 million. The report caveats this by finding that only 3% of the 1,700 adaptation initiatives surveyed had reported a real reduction in climate risks to local communities.The report lauds the increasing momentum to ensure a sustainable financial system with the advancement of new tools such as sustainability investment criteria, climate-related disclosure principles, and the mainstreaming of the incorporation of climate risks into investment decisions.The Adaptation Gap Report 2020 places special focus on Nature-based Solutions (NbS), which promote protection, sustainable management, and restoration of ecosystems to reduce climate risks and ensure human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The report finds NbS lack funding proportional to the role they play in adaptation. Although support for green initiatives with some NbS component has risen over the past 20 years at the Global Environment Facility (GEF), GCF, Adaptation Fund, and International Climate Initiative (IKI), of USD 94 billion spent on climate change mitigation and adaptation, only USD 12 billion was spent on NbS.The report concludes by noting that achievingthe 2°C temperature target of the Paris Agreement could limit climate change-induced losses in annual economic growth to 1.6%, compared to 2.2% losses that would occur with 3°C warming. The report also calls for sustainability and climate to play a central role in COVID-19 pandemic recovery packages, and for updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to include net-zero commitments from all nations.

"22 August 2019: The World Health Organization (WHO) has released an analysis that finds improving wastewater and drinking water treatment can simultaneously improve human health and reduce most microplastics found in drinking water. To improve health and environment, the WHO recommends that policymakers and the public implement measures to better manage and reduce plastics use.The publication titled, ‘Microplastics in Drinking-Water,’ is the WHO’s first effort to examine the potential human health risks from exposure to microplastics, and it focuses on the impacts of microplastics exposure through drinking water. The report examines the evidence on microplastics in the water cycle, the potential health impacts from exposure, and the removal of microplastics during treatment of wastewater and drinking water. The analysis finds that microplastics larger than 150 micrometres “are not likely to be absorbed in the human body,” and the uptake of smaller particles is likely to be limited. Although data is limited, the report states that absorption and distribution of very small microplastics, including nano-plastics, may be higher. The report concludes that further research is necessary to have a more accurate assessment of microplastic exposure and their impacts on human health.WHO Director, Department of Public Health, Environment and Social Determinants of Health, Maria Neira, explained “we urgently need to know more about the health impact of microplastics because they are everywhere – including in our drinking-water.” She stressed the importance of finding out more about microplastics in drinking water and of stopping “the rise in plastic pollution worldwide.”Per the report, the key sources of microplastic pollution are terrestrial run-off and wastewater effluent. The most common plastic particles found in drinking water are plastic bottle fragments. Wastewater treatment can remove over 90 percent of microplastics, and conventional drinking-water treatment generally removes particles smaller than a micrometre. The highest removal comes from tertiary treatment like filtration. The report concludes that water treatment processes “can effectively remove microplastics.”The report concludes that water treatment processes “can effectively remove microplastics.”However, the report stresses that a significant proportion of the global population does not currently have access to adequate water and sewage treatment and that wastewater and drinking water treatment may not be optimized to remove microplastics. By improving wastewater treatment, the report suggests governments, regulators, drinking-water suppliers and communities simultaneously tackle microplastics. It recommends water suppliers optimize water treatment processes for particle removal and microbial safety, which will also improve the removal of microplastic particles.To better understand the human health risks from microplastics and inform management actions, the report recommends further analysis on the sources and occurrence of microplastics in freshwater and throughout the water supply chain and on the efficacy of different treatment processes. The report also recommends developing standard methodologies for measuring microplastics in freshwater. To reduce microplastic pollution, the report suggests a number of actions, such as improving recycling programs and circular economy solutions, decreasing industrial waste inputs into the environment and reducing littering.

"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published its first comprehensive review of its eTrade Readiness Assessment Programme. Initiated in 2017, the programme aims to identify and address challenges to the development of e-commerce, primarily in least developed countries (LDCs).Titled, ‘Fast-tracking implementation of eTrade Readiness Assessments,’ the report evaluates implementation measures taken in response to earlier recommendations made in seven policy areas:E-commerce readiness and strategy formulation;Information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and services;Trade facilitation and logistics;Legal and regulatory framework;Payment solutions;Skills development; andAccess to financing.The recommendations are borne of the demand-driven eTrade readiness assessments themselves, which provide an overview of the beneficiary country’s e-commerce ecosystem. Out of 18 countries that had assessments completed by June 2019, the report focuses on and scores 13 that responded to a comprehensive analytical questionnaire, in order to better understand progress made in each.The report shows that implementation of the recommendations is moving at varying speeds. The overall implementation rate stands at 50%, with Cambodia, Togo, Senegal, and Myanmar ranking as the best performers. By policy area, payment solutions, ICT infrastructure and services, and legal and regulatory framework feature the highest implementation rates.Access to finance shows the lowest rate of implementation, and all but one respondent country noted that funding shortages are a major bottleneck that hinders implementation of the other eTrade recommendations. Other challenges include weak institutional capacities and policy coordination mechanisms, despite the commitment and intentions of the beneficiary countries to translate the recommendations into action.To enable and sustain implementation efforts, UNCTAD recommends that beneficiary countries, among other actions:Mainstream eTrade recommendations throughout implementation mechanisms of national development strategies;Establish a steering committee to enhance policy coordination;Identify champions within the public and private sectors that can take part in the steering committee and drive progress on the seven policy areas; andUtilize the eTrade Ready Action Matrix to mobilize support and catalyze development partners’ commitments.The countries whose progress and actions are described in the report are Burkina Faso, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa; Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, and Nepal in Asia; and Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu in the Pacific Islands region. Out of these 18 countries, Samoa is the only non-LDC.In the past three years, 27 eTrade readiness assessments have been conducted out of 43 country requests received.

"UN Member States have agreed on plans to adopt a new ten-year programme of action for the least developed countries (LDCs). The framework will succeed the Istanbul Programme of Action for the LDCs (IPoA), which concludes in 2020.On 11 August 2020, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution on the scheduling of the Fifth UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC-V), which originally wasplannedfor March 2021. In recognition of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Assembly agrees in resolution 74/232 B that the Conference will take place instead from 23-27 January 2022, “at the highest possible level, including Heads of State and Government,” in Doha, Qatar. The intergovernmental preparatory committee will meet from 24-28 May 2021, and from 26-30 July 2021.In addition, the text invites the UNGA President and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to hold a half-day dedicated thematic event during the 75th UNGA session, to provide substantive input to the Conference.The Conference is expected to yield a programme of action to build upon theIPoAfor 2011-2020, adopted at the Fourth UN Conference on LDCs (UNLDC-IV) in 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. The goal of the that ten-year Programme was to overcome LDCs’ structural challenges in order to eradicate poverty and achieve internationally agreed development goals. The 2022 conference is expected to appraise the results and adopt a new, strengthened framework to support LDCs.The UN Office of the High Representative for the LDCs, the Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) notes that the new LDC programmeof action will be adopted at “a critical time, as it will coincide with the last 10 years of implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”In July 2020 the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)adopted a resolutionexpressing concern about persistent gaps between the goals of the IPoA and achievements made to date. It notes that 80% of the world’s poor will live in fragile contexts by 2030, which poses “a major global threat to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” It also urges intensified cooperation to “contain, mitigate and defeat” COVID-19 and stresses the LDCs’ particular need for support.Conference preparations, including a road map updated in April 2020, are reported on this OHRLLSwebpage.Budgetary implications of the planned conference are outlined inthis statement. [UNGA Resolution] [Meeting Summary]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"25 September 2019: The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), The B Team and the World Benchmarking Alliance launched the ‘Business Avengers’ campaign. The campaign will focus on driving private sector awareness, collaboration and action in support of the SDGs.The campaign will bring together 17 companies, each chosen to represent one of the 17 SDGs, to promote the ‘Decade of Delivery’ between 2020 and 2030, the deadline for achieving the SDGs. Each company will communicate the overall importance of the Goals, the opportunities the Goals represent and their efforts to help achieve them. So far, the Business Avengers include: Arm, Avanti, the Coca-Cola Company, Commvault, Diageo, Google.org, Mars, Mastercard, Microsoft, Nike, rb, SAP, salesforce, salesforce.org and Unilever. Together, these companies represent over USD500 billion in revenue and have 900,000 employees.The campaign website shares tools and actions for companies to use in engaging their organization and employees in raising awareness on the SDGs. A letter from SDG leaders to businesses, for instance, outlines five things companies can do to advance the SDGs, from assessing the company’s impact against the SDGs and identifying related opportunities and risks across the company’s entire value chain, to sharing company goals to contribute to the SDGs with shareholders and other stakeholders. The website describes why the Goals matter to everyone, and underscores the importance of the SDGs for businesses’ future success around the world.In a press release about joining the Business Avengers campaign, Diageo expresses its support for 2020 “as a year of activism to help shift the world onto a path to deliver the Goals by 2030.” The company reports that its 2020 Sustainability and Responsibility targets provide a framework to measure and track its progress and ensure it is actively contributing to achieving the SDGs. Diageo emphasizes that “one of the best ways we can contribute to communities is by engaging others” to become advocates for causes important to them and their stakeholders, and calls for increased collaboration to help shift the world onto a path to deliver the SDGs by 2030.The campaign launch took place on 25 September 2019, on the sidelines of the SDG Summit at UN headquarters in New York, US. Project Everyone Co-Founder, Richard Curtis, explained that the world has made “nowhere near enough” progress to deliver on the promises made in 2015, in his remarks at the launch.

"The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published it latest Interim Economic Outlook, which warns that the coronavirus (COVID-19) presents the global economy with its greatest threat since the financial crisis.The Outlook, titled, ‘Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk,’ investigates best- and worst-case scenarios and calls on governments to act immediately to limit the spread of the virus, protect people and businesses from its effects, and strengthen economic demand.The report notes that broader spread of the virus across the wider Asia-Pacific region and advanced economies could result in global growth as low as 1.5% this year, cutting in half the OECD’s 2020 projection from November 2019. Containment measures and loss of confidence could reduce production and spending and lead to a recession in some countries.G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus.The report calls for flexible working situations to keep as many jobs as possible, and implementation of temporary tax and budgetary measures to soften the impact in affected sectors, such as travel and tourism. The OECD also calls for adequate liquidity in the most affected countries to enable banks to help companies with cash-flow problems while containing the virus.The report points out that the G20 economies should lead an internationally-coordinated effort for health care support and fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence. The Outlook concludes that,inter alia:contractions in China are being felt globally, reflecting China’s critical role in global supply chains, travel and commodity market;outbreaks in other economies are having similar effects;prospects for China have been revised, with growth slipping below 5% in 2020, before recovering to over 6% in 2021, as output returns to levels projected prior to the outbreak of the virus;the adverse impacts on confidence, financial markets, the travel sector and disruption to supply chains contribute to the downward revisions in all G20 economies in 2020; anda longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America could cause global growth could drop to 1.5% in 2020, half the projected rate prior to the outbreak.The Outlook calls for: ensuring well-resourced public health measures to prevent infection and contagion; implementing policies that support health care systems and workers; and protecting incomes of vulnerable social groups and businesses. The report further states that macroeconomic policies can help restore confidence and demand recovery as outbreaks ease, but that it cannot offset immediate disruptions from enforced shutdowns and travel restrictions. If growth is weaker for an extended period of time, coordinated multilateral action will be required. [OECD News Story] [Publication Landing Page] [Publication:Coronavirus: The World Economy at Risk]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"29 June 2019: Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and UN Secretary-General António Guterres reaffirmed their “strong commitment” to enhancing international cooperation on climate change to ensure implementation of the Paris Agreement. The announcement came at the conclusion of a trilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Osaka, Japan.In his remarks, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the commitment of both China and France to a multilateral approach to climate change has been critical to the climate regime’s success. He reiterated that the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 is expected to raise ambition and ensure that progress is made on the commitment to mobilize USD 100 billion per year for mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries, from both the public and the private sectors, to,inter alia, help replenish the Green Climate Fund (GCF).China and France reaffirmed their commitment to update and enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and publish their long-term mid-century low emission development strategies (LEDS) by 2020 in the context of sustainable development.Meeting participants underscored the importance of,inter alia:increasing financing for nature-based solutions, which can mitigate climate change, build climate resilience and help realize the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs;sustainably managing forests as carbon sinks and for their role in biodiversity protection;leveraging adaptation and mitigation finance for developing countries; anddecent, high-quality jobs in transitioning to low-emission and climate-resilient development.They also agreed to cooperate on elucidating the climate-biodiversity link and contribute to developing the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.China and France are co-leads of the ‘Nature Based Solutions’ and ‘Climate Finance and Carbon Pricing’ coalitions, respectively, for the UN Climate Summit. The three sides encouraged all countries to actively participate in the Summit, and present “their visions” and actions for increasing ambition.France and the UN said they would cooperate with China to align related infrastructure investments with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They also said they would support improved energy efficiency standards in the cooling sector, recognizing the climate and economic benefits of phasing out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and welcomed China’s national Green and High Efficiency Cooling Action Plan.The meeting took place on 29 June 2019.

"22 September 2019: A synthesis report titled, ‘United in Science,’ marshals the growing evidence that “climate impacts are hitting harder and sooner than climate assessments indicated even a decade ago,” with a real risk of crossing critical tipping points. Coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) the report was commissioned by the Science Advisory Group to the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit with a view to providing a “transparent envelope” of authoritative and actionable cutting-edge science to world leaders.The synthesis report provides a cohesive assessment of the state of the earth system under the increasing influence of anthropogenic climate change. It also outlines humanity’s response thus far, and makes projections of the far-reaching changes of the global climate in the future. The report is structured around key messages as well as short summaries of global studies conducted by the contributing agencies.Data sources used in the report include the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)Emissions Gap Report, three IPCC Special Reports released in 2018 and 2019 (theSpecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C(SR15), theSpecial Report on Climate Change and Land(SRCCL) and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)), as well as studies by the Global Carbon Project, Future Earth and Earth League, and the Global Framework for Climate Services.Some of the conclusions highlighted in the synthesis include:Global average temperature for 2015-2019 is on track to be the warmest of any equivalent period on record. It has already increased by 1.1°C above preindustrial levels, and it is now 0.2°C warmer than 2011-2015.Levels of the main long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have reached new highs, locking in the warming trend for generations to come.The emissions gap in 2030 between emission levels under full implementation of conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and levels consistent with least-cost pathways to the 2°C target is 13 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e). If just the unconditional NDCs are implemented, the gap increases to 15 GtCO2e. The gap in the case of the 1.5°C target is 29 GtCO2e and 32 GtCO2e, respectively.The level of ambition in current NDCs needs to be roughly tripled to align with the 2°C limit and increased around fivefold to align with the 1.5°C limit.The report emphasizes that the Paris Agreement on climate change can only be achieved if “immediate and all-inclusive action” is taken, encompassing deep decarbonization, complemented by ambitious policy measures, protection and enhancement of carbon sinks and biodiversity, and efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. With regard to bridging the emissions gap, the report adds that part of the technical potential can be realized through scaling up and replicating existing, well-proven policies that simultaneously contribute to key SDGs such as switching to renewable energy and reforestation.

"June 2019: The UN Sustainable Development Group published an internal guidance note on the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (previously the UN Development Assistance Framework), which guides the planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting and evaluation of collective UN support to the 2030 Agenda implementation. The Cooperation Framework has primacy in driving major UN development system contributions at the country level.The UN General Assembly (UNGA)resolution 72/279on ‘Repositioning of the UN development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the UN system’ (QCPR) elevated the Cooperation Framework as “the most important instrument” for planning and implementation of UN development activities at the country level in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. In the foreword to the internal guidance note, Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group, notes that the new Cooperation Framework is “a centerpiece” of the UN reform process.The new Cooperation Framework is “a centerpiece” of the UN reform process.The note explains that the UN Development “Assistance” Framework (UNDAF) has been renamed the UN “Sustainable” Development “Cooperation” Framework to more accurately reflect the contemporary relationship between governments and the UN development system in collaborating to achieve the SDGs. It then goes on to identify the elements that differentiate the UNDAF from the current Cooperation Framework.The new guidelines emphasize that UN entity-specific country programmes are derived from the Cooperation Framework, no longer vice versa. The Cooperation Framework begins and ends with an analysis of the national development landscape and SDG priorities, “including through the lens of the imperative to leave no one behind,” serving as “a core accountability tool” between the UN Country Team (UNCT) and the host government, as well as between and among UNCT members for “collectively-owned development results.”The UN Common Country Analysis (UN CCA), which underpins the Cooperation Framework, shifts from being a one-off event, as was the case with UNDAF, to a “real-time” core analytical function. It explicitly recognizes the regional and cross-border elements within the UN CCA and the Cooperation Framework. Periodic updating of the UN CCA will reduce the period for formulating a new Cooperation Framework, the internal guidance note explains, from 14.5 months (on average globally) to 6-9 months. By the text, the SDG targets and indicators become “the default monitoring framework,” informed by country-defined and disaggregated baselines. These indicators are to be tracked online through UN INFO at country, regional and global levels, the note explains.The new Cooperation Framework will first trigger a review of the UNCT configuration to ensure it has the capacities to deliver on stipulated commitments and will be signed only after this step is completed, with budgeting following signature. The note mentions that the budget is positioned “in the larger context of SDG financing.” The UN Resident Coordinator will play an enhanced leadership role throughout the Cooperation Framework process as compared to UNDAF.

"A publication by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Thematic Research Network on Data and Statistics (TReNDS) identifies four building blocks for innovative and inclusive national data systems for SDGs. The recommendations respond to main data challenges identified in the report, including acute capacity gaps, lack of political leadership and inadequate financing.Thereporttitled, ‘Counting on the World to Act – A Roadmap for Governments to Achieve Modern Data Systems for Sustainable Development,’ suggests an action plan for governments and their development partners aimed at supporting the delivery of the SDGs by 2030 through building and leading a new data ecosystem. The recommendations have been designed for national statisticians, chief data scientists, chief data officers, ministers of planning and others concerned with evidence-based decision-making in support of sustainable development.The report shows that while there are some signs of progress, such as growing evidence of satellite imagery and other innovative techniques being used to augment traditional statistical methods, “persistent” data gaps and lags remain in many countries. For instance, countries in Africa and Asia, on average, have data available to monitor only 20% of SDG indicators, and only 35% of sub-Saharan African countries have poverty data collected since 2015. The authors also note that policymakers struggle to accurately track the estimated 25.4 million refugees missing from national statistics worldwide, and to monitor shoreline change to curb erosion rates within 24% of the world’s sandy beaches.The publication underscores that world leaders and their development partners need better information to assess progress, make real-time course corrections – explained as redirecting services and investments in response to most pressing needs – and craft forward-looking projections. According to the authors, this requires that intra-national datasets can be compatibly integrated as parts of planetary-scale evaluations.To that end, the report proposes four building blocks for an effective and inclusive national data system:Strong leadership and governance with an empowered national statistician or relevant national data coordinator who is open and enabled to collaborate with third parties, and is actively encouraging a more inclusive international statistical system;Common principles, standards and policy frameworks to ensure data comparability and the capacity to integrate data from different sources, as well as a supportive environment for collaboration;An open, user-centric system that actively supports public and private data demands, collaboration and innovation at local, national and international levels; andA “robust” funding model that ensures the long-term production of vital data.The publication details how collaboration among a broad set of actors must occur across all stages of the data process, from collection and cleaning through dissemination and analysis, as well as the institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities, and incentives necessary to catalyze this multi-stakeholder collaboration.The recommendations provided are inspired by best practices and examples from Bangladesh, Colombia and the Philippines, among others, which are presented to illustrate the power of governments to make needed changes even when constrained by resources.

"The International Labour Organization (ILO) has released a report that finds the number of young people around the world not in employment, education or training (NEET) (SDG target 8.6.1) has been increasing since 2017. The report states that this SDG target “will be missed,” underscoring the need to increase “efforts to generate decent jobs for the next generation of workers.”The report titled, ‘Global Employment Trends for Youth 2020: Technology and the Future of Jobs,’ highlights that the number of young people classified as NEET has risen from 259 million in 2016 to 267 million in 2019, and is expected to continue increasing to approximately 273 million in 2021. Young women are twice as likely as young men to face precarious employment situations, and two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women. The gender gap is even more pronounced in the Arab States and Southern Asia, where cultural and social norms are more likely to prevent women from pursuing education or working outside the house. Youth unemployment also varies by region, from 30% in Northern Africa to less than 9% in Northern America.Two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women.The report finds that a narrow focus on vocational training, a lack of jobs to match qualifications, and increasing automation are creating a “precarious future in the labor market” for young people. Employees between the ages of 15 and 24 are at greater risk of losing their jobs because of further technological advances than older workers.The report also identifies challenges with vocational training, which tends to impart occupation-specific skills that become obsolete faster than general education skills. As a result, employees with vocational training are even more vulnerable. To address these concerns, the report calls for modernizing vocational training programmes to meet the evolving demands of the digital economy.Young people who complete tertiary education are less likely to lose jobs to automation. However, the increase in the number of young people with degrees has outpaced the demand for graduate labor, resulting in falling returns to tertiary education and pushing down wages for graduates. The report addresses a number of additional challenges, including informal and less secure forms of employment and a digital divide between regions and generations.The report recommends an integrated policy framework to support young people’s ascent into decent jobs and to assure that new technologies positively impact on youth employment. The report argues for policies to generate a sufficient number of decent jobs, to equip young people with the skills needed for those jobs, and ensure social protection for workers.The ILO also produced briefing notes on youth employment trends by region.

"The Federal Government of Mexico issued a Sovereign SDG Bond, the first country to do so. The bond features two eligibility criteria: a geospatial criterion that prioritizes vulnerable populations; and a governance criterion linked to the involvement of a UN organization. The bond is also the first to use the SDGs as an entry point, not only in ex-post mapping,according to the investment bankthat helped Mexico design the bond.Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit announced the initiative on 15 September 2020 as part of its sustainable financing program and thefirst partof a recurring finance tool. It is a seven-year bond for USD 890 million to be used through a “SDG localized finance” approach.Natixis indicates that Mexico’s approach to a sovereign SDG bond could be duplicated by other countries, but “requires a strong bedrock” in three areas: institutional capacity, budget mapping against the SDGs, and sub-national data to inform the geospatial eligibility criterion.On the geospatial eligibility, Natixis reports that the SDG bond issuances will finance projects located in 1,345 municipalities in Mexico selected because of illiteracy rates, school attendance rates, level of health services deprivation, lack of toilets, drainage or piped water in houses, absence of electricity access or basic equipment such as refrigerators. The geospatial eligibility is based on “very granular open data.”On the governance eligibility, Natixis explains that the main governance innovation in the bond framework is the involvement of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which had worked with Mexico on its SDG budget mapping.InUNDP’s press releaseabout the bond, Administrator Achim Steiner expressed hope that other countries will soon follow Mexico by establishing their own sovereign SDG bonds.[SDG Sovereign Bond Framework]",0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"11 July 2019: The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), with support from the Government of Sweden, have issued a report examining the role of the private sector in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.The report titled, ‘Engaging Business in the NDCs: Policy Recommendations on the Role of the Private Sector and Reporting,’ analyzes corporate reporting practices through the first round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and discusses examples of good practice.To meet the challenging goals in the Paris Agreement, governments alone cannot achieve the changes required.The report recommends that policymakers: include clear targets for private business contributions; set up efficient and transparent monitoring processes that include data from the private sector; and provide support to encourage private sector engagement. For the private sector, it recommends that businesses: align operations and sustainability objectives to national targets; explore business opportunities to support NDCs through investments and changes to their operations; and proactively engage policymakers at the national level.Examples of good practices presented in the report include: the establishment by countries of monitoring processes to track progress and adapt the strategy regularly; investing in enabling factors to further support private sector involvement; and identifying the budget and the conditions needed for its implementation to reach sectoral targets.Speaking about the report, Peter Paul van de Wijs, Chief External Affairs Officer, GRI, noted that in order to “meet the challenging goals in the Paris Agreement, governments alone cannot achieve the changes required.” “Businesses,” he said, “also have a crucial role, which is why we need clarity on each other’s contribution.”Published as a contribution to in-depth review of SDG 13 (climate action) by the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2019, the report will also contribute to discussions during the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019, prior to countries submitting their next round of NDCs in 2020.

"The UN General Assembly held a high-level meeting to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, which yielded the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action on gender equality. Among the over 100 leaders speaking via pre-recorded statements, President of Georgia Salome Zourabichvili highlighted the legacy of US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, “one of the most fervent fighters for women’s rights.”In 2020, the Beijing Declaration would have “no chance of being adopted,” asserted Emanuel Macron, President of France. He pointed to reversals of progress on women’s rights and the denial of women’s right to make decisions about their bodies and to abortion.The President of Georgia highlighted the legacy of US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, “one of the most fervent fighters for women’s rights.”As the host country of the 1995 conference, Xi Jinping, President of China, called for mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on women, especially front‑line workers. Xi stressed that women’s rights and interests are central to sustainable development and called on the UN to redouble efforts to address emerging challenges for women, including bridging the gender‑digital divide. China announced a pledge of USD5 million to UN Women over the next five years.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresstressedthe importance of equal representation of women in leadership positions, “in Governments, boardrooms, in climate negotiations and at the peace table — everywhere decisions are taken that affect people’s lives.” He noted that progress has been made since 1995, including a drop in maternal mortality by nearly 40 percent and more girls attend school than ever before in history. Nevertheless, he cited estimates that, on average, women have just 75 percent of the legal rights of men.The high-level meeting of the UNGA took place in the context of the‘Generation Equality’ campaignled by UN Women, which places a focus on intergenerational and youth engagement to advance gender equality. On 1 October, UN Womenannouncedthat it had added 11 youth leaders to the membership of its Generation Equality Youth Task Force, which was established to facilitate youth leadership and participation in the upcoming Generation Equality Forum.The Forum will be a civil society-centered, global gathering for gender equality, convened by UN Women and co-hosted by the governments of Mexico and France in 2021. The Forum will launch a set of concrete, ambitious, and transformative actions to achieve immediate and irreversible progress towards gender equality.

"July 2019: The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics and the Global Education Monitoring Report have issued a joint assessment of progress toward SDG 4 (quality education). The report finds mixed global progress towards education targets, and calls on countries to “put an end to complacency.”Available statistics show that school completion rates are far from universal, and low-income countries fare poorly in terms of infrastructure in schools (SDG target 4.a), with just 32%% of primary schools having access to electricity, and 60% of upper secondary schools having access to sanitation facilities. The report titled, ‘Meeting Commitments: Are Countries on Track to Achieve SDG4?’, sets out findings by each SDG 4 target. With regard to target 4.1 on school completion, 18% of all school-age children and youth did not attend school in 2017, and global trends suggest there will only be only a slight improvement, with 14% of chilld-age children failing to complete their scho0oling by 2030. On early childhood education (target 4.2), the report notes that just 62% of pre-school-age children in low-income countries are considered to be “on track” with readiness to enter primary school. On literacy (target 4.6), the youth literacy rate is expected to reach 94% and the adult literacy rate 90% by 2030. On education for sustainable development (target 4.7), 60% of reporting countries have “fully reflected” the target in national education policies.The report finds substantial gaps in data available for assessing progress against several SDG 4 targets. Monitoring also has been hampered by the lack of an agreed methodology to measure several SDG 4 targets. To fill the gaps, they recommend that countries prioritize conducting learning assessments, and carry out household or school surveys that provide data on targets that are not currently being monitored by education systems. These include SDG targets 4.3 on tertiary education, 4.4 on relevant work skills, 4.6 on literacy, as well as 4.a and 4.c. The authors call on aid donors to make up the difference between the USD148 million currently spent on such monitoring per year, bringing resources to the USD280 million year that they estimate is needed.The Education for 2030 Framework for Action, a global plan agreed by countries in 2015, urges governments to allocate at least 4-5% of GDP and less than 15% of their national budget on education. However, at present, one in four countries do not meet this minimum recommended level.The SDG 4 monitoring report was issued ahead of the first-ever intergovernmental review of SDG 4, which took place during the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in New York, US.

"The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has released its flagship report titled, ‘Global Renewables Outlook: Energy Transformation 2050.’ It features a policy framework that supports the decarbonisation of the global energy system through 2050.In its ‘Deeper Decarbonisation Perspective,’ the report explores decarbonisation options for more challenging sectors such as shipping, aviation, and heavy industry, with a view to lowering carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to zero. The report notes that addressing these challenges in the near term will be critical to reaching net-zero emissions in the second half of the century.With regard to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report’s foreword notes that government stimulus packages will likely shape societies and economies for years to come. It therefore highlights the importance of aligning these responses to the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. Per the text, “stimulus and recovery packages should accelerate the shift to sustainable, decarbonised economies and resilient inclusive societies” with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) forming the backbone of COVID-19 response.The report goes on to review energy transformation through a regional lens. Beyond previous studies, it provides a “vision for transformative energy policies as the conduit to the creation of a deeply decarbonised global society.” The publication’s key findings focus on the specific transition prospects for 10 regions globally. Overall it finds that:Energy-related CO2emissions have risen by 1% per year on average since 2010;The transition to renewables, efficiency, and electrification can drive broad socio-economic development;The last portion of CO2 emissions will be the hardest and most expensive to eliminate, meaning innovative technologies, business models and behavioral changes will be needed to reach zero emissions;Decarbonising energy use in time to avert catastrophic climate change requires intensified international co-operation; andRecovery measures following the COVID-19 pandemic could include flexible power grids, efficiency solutions, electric vehicle charging, energy storage, interconnected hydro-power, green hydrogen and other technology investments consistent with long-term energy and climate sustainability.The report is accompanied by aSummaryand a digital story titled, ‘Beyond crisis: Renewable energy for a low-carbon future.’ [Publication:Global Renewables Outlook: Energy Transformation 2050]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"2 October 2019: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has made its central statistical database available online, including data on SDG indicators where available. The database is searchable by country, keywords and sub-region, and provides summaries of progress towards each SDG.The Key Indicators Database contains macroeconomic and social data on 49 countries beginning with the year 2000, relating to: people, economy and output; money, finance, and prices; globalization; transport and communications; energy and electricity; and the environment. It is updated once a year, providing users with an interactive tool in complement to the annual publication of thekey indicators report. The most recent data update was made on 2 October 2019.On eradicating poverty (SDG 1), the analysis shows that developing countries in Asia have made great gains. From 2002 to 2018, all sub-regions greatly reduced extreme poverty, with East Asia being the most successful, as just 0.7% of population remains in extreme poverty. Cambodia, Nepal and Tajikistan were most successful in reducing the share of the working poor as a percentage of the total population. Whereas in 2002, developing countries in Asia had 1.1 billion people leaving in extreme poverty, this number fell to 264 million by 2015.

"The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has published an assessment of eight issues of concern for the sound management of chemicals and waste. The report is intended to support discussions at the fifth session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5) in February 2021.The issues were identified by the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), and other international fora working towards the sound management of chemicals and waste as part of the SDGs.The eight issues are:chemicals in products;endocrine disrupting chemicals;environmentally persistent pharmaceutical pollutants;hazardous substances in the life cycle of electrical and electronic products;highly hazardous pesticides;lead in paint;nanotechnology and manufactured nanomaterials (nanomaterials); andper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.For each issue, the report notes the environmental or human health effects, reviews current regulatory and policy frameworks, highlights challenges and opportunities, and considers ways to communicate and scale up existing instruments and lessons learned, particularly for developing countries.While progress has been made, the report acknowledges that SDG target 12.4 – which has a 2020 deadline – has not been achieved. Target 12.4 calls for achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment by 2020.The report suggests addressing a wider range of issues of concern, including those that have previously received insufficient attention, rather than specific hazardous chemicals or groups of chemicals. This includes issues where sound management is necessary to achieve greater sustainability and wider environmental or development objectives. The authors suggest that countries and other stakeholders could nominate additional issues of concern. Horizon scanning could also be used.The report also suggests linking to upcoming discussions at UNEA-5 on strengthening the science-policy interface.The authors urge addressing issues of concern in an integrated and holistic manner, including using a sector-specific value chain approach, grouping substances by similar intrinsic properties, or considering all life-cycle stages of specific chemicals and products. They also argue for integrating efforts on sound chemicals and waste management with other priorities, such as climate change, biodiversity, human rights, and labor standards.According to the report, an enabling environment to address emerging issues and issues of concern would include: strengthened leadership with clear roles and responsibilities to coordinate action; regular monitoring and evaluation of progress; new mechanisms, including legally binding ones, to increase efforts on addressing issues where progress has been limited; knowledge management, including knowledge capture, synthesis, and sharing; and increased involvement of the scientific community.The assessment report was requested by UNEA-4 in March 2019. [Publication:An Assessment Report on Issues of Concern]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"July 2019: The South African SDG Hub at the University of Pretoria has released a policy brief that explores the relationship between science, technology and innovation (STI) and the SDGs. Titled, ‘Cloud Computing and the Sustainable Development Goals in South Africa: An Opportunity to Accelerate Progress,’ the brief focuses on the potentially transformative impact of cloud computing.Authored by Willem Fourie, the brief argues that cloud computing has the potential to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs by enabling cost-effective access to cutting-edge technologies. Such technologies can improve the efficiency of existing systems, Fourie maintains. They also contribute to an “enabling environment for game-changing innovation.”The brief suggests that cloud computing’s potential to accelerate the attainment of the SDGs could be unlocked by putting a number of policies, safeguards, infrastructure and skills in place. The policies are to integrate science, technology and innovation throughout the development planning process, and to enable the free flow of data. The safeguards are to ensure the privacy and security of all data. The enabling infrastructure is to ensure affordable access to the internet and electricity. The recommendation with regard to skills is to develop cloud computing skills.The brief also reviews ways in which cloud computing is already accelerating progress towards attaining the SDGs across Africa. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) delivered through the cloud assists farmers in making more informed crop decisions by predicting crop yields.

"22 May 2019: The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Brabant Center for Sustainable Development released the ‘SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities.’ The report compares the performance of European capital cities and selected metropolitan areas on the SDGs.According to SDSN, approximately 65% of the SDGs’ 169 targets “will not be reached without proper engagement of, and coordination with, local and regional governments.” In addition, SDSN emphasizes that action at local levels is critical to achieve transformation in energy, transportation and urban planning, as well as in access to health and education, among other areas.The first-ever SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities features 45 European cities and covers 56 indicators. Oslo, Norway placed first, with a score of 74.8, which means that Oslo is 74.8% of the way to realizing the SDGs, based on the measures used in the Index. Stockholm, Sweden placed second with a score of 74.2, followed by Helsinki, Finland (71.3), Copenhagen, Denmark (68.7) and Zurich, Switzerland (67.5). The five lowest-performing cities are Bucharest, Hungary (54.4), Valletta, Malta (53.8), Nicosia, Cyprus (53.7), Porto, Portugal (53.5) and Athens, Greece (48.6).European cities perform better on SDGs 2 and 3 than US cities, due to healthier lifestyles.European cities performed best on SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). In addition, European cities perform better on SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 than US cities, which the report attributes to “healthier lifestyles that help prevent excessive weight gain” and chronic and preventable diseases.Cities in Europe performed the worst on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). Reporting that all European cities perform poorly on SDG 13, the author emphasize the need for further action to achieve zero net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030. The report states that poor performance on SDG 12 is a result of low shares of ground and surface water with good chemical status. Poor performance on SDG 15 is partially explained by a lack of green spaces and high percentage of soil sealing in European cities. In addition, most European cities face challenges in reducing air pollution. Another challenge in most European cities is access to affordable and quality housing (SDG target 11.1).The report highlights challenges in data availability, quality and comparability at the sub-national level. The report states that the European Commission (EC) has defined territorial levels and metropolitan areas and standardized subnational data and indicators, through the EC’s Joint Research Centre and Eurostat, but it stresses that “major gaps remain to monitor all SDGs.” In particular, the report cites challenges in measuring income and wealth inequalities and disparities in access to services, hindering the ability to measure the “leave no one behind” component of the 2030 Agenda.

"The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) has reported on progress in waste management in Pacific island countries made under the Moana Taka Partnership. Since its launch in March 2018, approximately 686 tonnes of waste have been shipped from eligible Pacific islands and territories for treatment and recycling in suitable ports in the Asia-Pacific region.The Partnership between SPREP and the China Navigation Company (CNCo), also known as SWIRE Shipping, allows for CNCo vessels to carry, free of charge, containers of recyclable waste from eligible ports in Pacific island countries and territories that have insufficient or inappropriate landfill space to store waste, have inadequate waste treatment facilities, and lack financial capacity to ship recyclable waste.Kosi Latu, Director General of SPREP, has described the Moana Taka Partnership as a “paddle in the right direction” towards tackling the “immense waste management challenge” in Pacific islands.The focus of the Partnership is on non-commercial waste streams and the types of materials that are considered recyclable, including plastics, aluminum cans, waste oil, and ozone depleting substances. Twenty-one Pacific island countries and territories are eligible to participate in the scheme.Examples of shipments of recyclable waste made thus far include: six containers of scrap metal from Samoa and Papua New Guinea; nine containers of plastic waste from Fiji; three containers of used oil from the Marshall Islands; and 16 containers of varied waste contents from Fiji.The Partnership contributes to implementation of thePacific Regional Waste and Pollution Management Strategy 2016-2015, ‘Cleaner Pacific 2025,’ a “comprehensive long-term strategy for integrated sustainable waste management and pollution prevention and control in the Pacific islands region until 2025.” Priority areas for management outlined in the Strategy include municipal solid waste, asbestos, electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), healthcare waste, chemicals (such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ozone depleting substances, and mercury), used oil and lubricants, marine litter, ship-sourced pollution, disaster waste, and liquid waste (such as sewage and trade waste).As such, the initiative forms an important contribution towards achieving SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols. [Pacific Environment Portal] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Launch of Moana Taka Partnership] [SDG Knowledge Hub Sources]* * *This story was made possible with funding support from the Government of Sweden through the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and was developed with the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) using thePacific Environment Portal, which enables users to find, access, and use regional and national data.

"The annual meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) took place during its originally scheduled dates, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant that other resemblances to previous HLPF sessions were limited.IISD’sEarth Negotiations Bulletinhighlights that, while the 7-16 July 2020 HLPF session “was originally intended to initiate a new four-year cycle to review the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and assess progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda)…it ended up being a rather unusual session.”The agenda was reoriented to focus on the pandemic and the event took place in a virtual format. By the conclusion of the eighth day, 72,000 viewers had followed the sessions online and over 240 side events had taken place, not to mention numerous special events, Voluntary National Review (VNR) “Labs” and other online discussions to address key challenges and directions forward for post-pandemic recovery.TheENBreport notes that UN Secretary-General António Guterres “put in perspective why the HLPF had to go ahead and meet even in a year when most other multilateral meetings and processes ground to a standstill.” He attributed the “devastating impact of COVID-19 to past and present failures in: taking the SDGs seriously; addressing inequalities; investing in resilience; empowering women and girls; heeding warnings about the damage to the natural environment; addressing climate change; and valuing international cooperation and solidarity.”Echoing this theme, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande warned that the “decade of action” has become a “decade of recovery,” and “called for the SDGs to be at the forefront of government strategies for recovery, to safeguard communities against future shocks.”A central focus of the HLPF is the presentation of Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). This year, 47 countries presented VNRs, with 26 presenting for the first time, 20 for the second time, and 1 for the third time. Countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. A summary of the VNRs, with links to the full documents, ishere.Among the HLPF 2020 takeaways discussed during an IISD wrap-upwebinarwere:speakers voiced strong calls for solidarity, inclusion and multilateralism;SDG implementation efforts should transition from a focus on individual goals to systemic responses;“Leave No One Behind” was emphasized, primarily with a focus on social protection;the pandemic’s economic consequences require attention, with speakers discussing associated debt relief and finance implications; andMajor Groups made their voices heard, particularly women and youth.Unlike other HLPF sessions, this meeting did not conclude with the adoption of a Ministerial Declaration. A draft had been developed, but agreement had not been reached by the close of the meeting on 16 July. ECOSOC President Mona Juul reported that “an ambitious declaration was emerging, but some issues required further discussion.” On Friday, 17 July, she circulated a reviseddraftministerial declaration and said that, if Member States raise no objection before 5:00 pm EDT on 22 July, the declaration will be considered as adopted.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has released the publication titled, ‘Safer Water, Better Health,’ which estimates the burden of 12 major diseases and adverse health impacts due to inadequate Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). The report also provides evidence for links between WASH and another 14 conditions, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that are not yet quantified.Thereportserves as an update and builds on the WHO’s previous analysis of environmental disease burdens and interventions. The agency’s (2016) findings showed that, globally, “1.9 million deaths and 123 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) could have been prevented with adequate WASH. The WASH-attributable disease burden amounted to 3.3% of global deaths and 4.6% of global DALYs.” Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the largest disease burden from inadequate WASH.The publication highlights the relationship between improper disposal of excreta, lack of hand washing facilities, and pathogens in drinking water on the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections. It describes how standing and wastewater are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which serve as additional disease vectors.For the following diseases – diarrhoeal diseases; respiratory infections; soil-transmitted helminthiasis; malaria; trachoma; schistosomiasis; lymphatic filariasis; onchocerciasis; dengue; Japanese encephalitis; protein-energy malnutrition; drowning; arsenicosis ; fluorosis ; legionellosis; leptospirosis; hepatitis A and hepatitis E; methaemoglobinaemia; cyanobacterial toxins; lead poisoning; scabies; spinal injury; poliomyelitis; and adverse neonatal conditions and maternal outcomes – the report gives a detailed account of links to inadequate WASH. Where possible, it also describes interventions and gives economic evaluations.The report draws particular attention to the impacts of inadequate WASH on young children, noting that, “among children under 5 years, WASH-attributable deaths represent 13% of deaths and 12% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs),” an outcome that could be prevented with existing prevention strategies and interventions. These interventions would include implementation of: water safety planning; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe recreational water environments; guidelines for drinking-water quality;  guidelines for safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater; and sanitation safety planning to prevent exposure to excreta along the sanitation chain.

ACP Secretary-General Patrick Gomes called for strengthening the global response to climate change in the context of sustainable development. Krista Mikkonen, Environment and Climate Change Minister, Finland, called for a “coherent and clear vision” towards achieving climate neutrality by 2050.From 2014 to 2018, EU funding for cooperation with the ACP Group of States on climate change totaled EUR 1.7 billion, which included strengthening the resilience and adaptation capacity of ACP countries through the Intra-ACP Global Climate Change Alliance Plus, a joint EU-ACP initiative worth EUR 70 million. ACP-EU cooperation also includes the EUR 85 million Climate Services Programme to strengthen capacities of regional hydrometeorological organizations to access and use climate information and services for policy decision making, and a EUR 100 million disaster risk reduction (DRR) programme to be launched in 2020 as a follow-up to an ongoing EUR 180 million programme. [ACP Press Release][EU Press Release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"The World Trade Organization (WTO) published its latest quarterly Goods Trade Barometer reading on 19 August 2020. The release shows a continued drop in goods trade associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, but hints at the early beginnings of stabilization.The WTO publishes two sets of indicators, each launched in September 2019. The Goods Trade Barometer (formerly the World Trade Outlook Indicator) shows how the latest data points compare to short-term trends in goods trade, providing an indication of potential trajectory in the near future based on a variety of component indices that are combined into a single composite index. The Services Trade Barometer combines six component indices into a composite index to illustrate the current state of services prior to the release of official statistics. Each is intended to complement traditional trade statistics and forecasts.An L-shaped, rather than V-shaped, recovery trajectory cannot be ruled out.Each barometer is normalized for medium-term trends, with a score of 100 indicating growth in line with medium-term trends. Scores that exceed 100 indicate above-trend growth, and those below 100 show below-trend growth. Scores that deviate by more than 5 points are considered substantially above or below trend.A WTO release notes that the latest Goods Trade Barometer’s composite score of 84.5 is 15.5 points below the baseline value of 100 for the index and down 18.6 points year-on-year. This scoring is generally consistent with the WTO’s June statistics, which imply a 14% drop in global trade volume between the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. While nearly all drivers of goods trade considered (export orders, automotive products, container shipping, air freight, electronic components, and raw materials) have declined, the WTO suggests that the indices “have held up relatively well” and that world trade in 2020 may be evolving in line with the less pessimistic scenario outlined in anApril forecast. The release cautions however, that a “V-shaped” recovery is uncertain, and emphasizes the possibility of an “L-shaped” pathway where global trade levels out “well below its pre-pandemic trajectory.”A methodology document notes that the Trade Goods Barometer is published quarterly, whereas the Services Trade Barometer is updated twice per year.

"7 September 2019: Sand and Dust Storms Day at the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14) saw the launch of an international coalition for action on sand and dust storms (SDS). Among other activities, the coalition will develop an SDS source base map with the goal of improving monitoring and response to these storms.According to an UNCCD press release on the Day, “China called for robust international collaboration, especially developing joint standards on SDS intensity and undertaking large-scale interventions. India, the host country of the UNCCD COP14, presented its plan to develop SDS guidance for its states, while Iran reminded the participants that the rich body of traditional and modern knowledge on SDS hot spots could help create a stronger knowledge base [for] regional initiatives.”SDS affect approximately 77% of UNCCD country Parties, or approximately 151 countries. Of these, 45 are classified as SDS source areas. To mitigate this phenomena, which have various health, economic, and environmental impacts, the UNCCD supports a three-pillar approach that focuses on (1) early warning systems; (2) preparedness and resilience; and (3) anthropogenic source mitigation. Within this framework, the Convention supports joint research and monitoring, capacity building, policy development, disaster planning, and sustainable land management measures, in addition to other actions.A guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub titled, ‘Dust Disregards Political Boundaries’discusses how momentum to address SDS has been growing. In December 2017, for instance, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address SDS.Coalition members include: UN Environment Programme (UNEP), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), World Health Organization (WHO), UN Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).UNCCD COP 14 is convening in Delhi, India from 2-14 September 2019.

"UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande has issued a roadmap to fulfilling his vision for the 74th session. The road map emphasizes support for SDG 4 (quality education), inclusion, gender equality, financial integrity and events marking the UN’s 75th anniversary.According to the roadmap dated 19 November 2019, on fulfilling the 2030 Agenda, the President will focus in particular on poverty eradication (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), quality education (SDG 4) and climate action (SDG 13). He will also emphasize their interlinkages and the “interconnected character” of all SDGs.On SDG 4, the roadmap points to the high global illiteracy rate, noting that “no nation can develop beyond its educational capacity.” The President aims to raise awareness of and mobilize action around five areas: access to quality education; adequate infrastructure for education; quality of teachers; technology; and partnerships.The President will appoint co-facilitators for negotiations on a declaration to be adopted at the UN’s 75th anniversary event.Muhammad-Bande also underlines a cross-cutting focus on inclusion, particularly for youth, women and persons with disabilities. As part of this inclusion focus, the President will issue a paper on gender quality and women’s empowerment.Also on gender equality, which is the subject of SDG 5, the roadmap indicates that the President will convene a one-day, high-level meeting on 23 September 2020 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, and the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (Beijing+25). The President also plans to advance: women’s role in peace and security; the importance of women’s participation at all levels of decision making in preventing, managing and resolving conflicts; and the need to develop peace and security policies, plans and programmes with a gender perspective.On the 75th anniversary of the UN, the roadmap says the President will facilitate preparations by:convening a Youth Plenary in conjunction with the Youth Forum (20-23 April 2020);establishing modalities for the 26 June 2020 event to commemorate the signing of the UN Charter, and the 24 October 2020 event to commemorate UN Day; andappointing co-facilitators to lead intergovernmental negotiations on a declaration to be adopted at the UNGA’s high-level meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary, on 21 September 2020.In addition, Muhammad-Bande intends to address the need for stronger partnerships to implement the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FfD). He will publish a paper on initiatives related to combatting illicit financial flows and strengthening good practices on assets return, among other aspects of financial integrity.

"12 July 2019: On the sidelines of the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), a side event addressed the need to strengthen the science-policy interface (SPI) to integrate climate change, resilience and the SDGs.The event, organized by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), shared recommendations on integrating climate change provisions from the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and the SDGs by strengthening the SPI.The event highlighted that: leveraging synergies and avoiding trade-offs between climate action and development priorities can help limit global warming, as underscored in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C(SR15); knowledge co-creation can enhance science-policy dialogues and should also include local communities; and improved communication and coordination are critical for strengthening the SPI and combating climate change.During the event, Kazuhiko Takeuchi, IGES, explained that Japan’s Fifth Basic Environment Plan advances a low-carbon, self-reliant and decentralized society based on living in harmony with nature, while reinforcing such concepts as the circular economy.Heide Hackmann, International Science Council, urged scientists to “keep pushing” for integrating the natural and social sciences.Lynn Wagner, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), suggested that decisions related to the “how, who and what” of the science-policy interface — the credibility, legitimacy and salience — should be evaluated with a “2030 Agenda lens.”Pungkas B. Ali, Indonesia, discussed the ways in which his country is increasing energy efficiency, while reducing emissions and minimizing extreme poverty.Jamil Ahmad, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), underscored the UN’s focus on coordination in its support of SDG implementation.Panelists and participants also called for: enhanced partnerships, emphasizing the role of academia and citizens in achieving the SDGs; including community leaders and democratic processes when trying to bridge science-policy gaps; and reviewing and strengthening incentives for effective SPI.IISD Reporting Services is coveringselected side eventsduring the 2019 HLPF.

"2 July 2019: UN Member States have reached agreement on the outcome document of the SDG Summit. The final text includes a reference to marine plastic litter that had not appeared in the previous versions.The SDG Summit is the meeting of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) to be convened under the auspices of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at the level of Heads of State and Government, from 24-25 September 2019. The UNGA is expected to adopt the political declaration during the opening session of the Summit.The amended draft includes “discharge of plastic litter into the oceans” among the issues on which progress is slow, and which could bring disastrous consequences for humanity.The text was developed throughconsultationsco-facilitated by Sheila Carey, Permanent Representative of Bahamas, and Olof Skoog, Permanent Representative of Sweden, between May and July. On 21 June the co-facilitatorscirculateda draft of the declaration under the silence procedure, but after extending the silence procedure until 28 June, theyannouncedthat the silence had been broken by a Member State.The co-facilitators reported that this delegation asked for an amendment in paragraph 20, which expresses concern about issues on which “progress is slow.” The amended sentence was requested to read, “Biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, discharge of plastic litter into the oceans, climate change and increasing disaster risk continue at rates that bring potentially disastrous consequences for humanity.” The co-facilitators consulted with Member States, and this version is nowagreed.In her letter transmitting the final draft, UNGA President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said she looks forward to its adoption “by consensus” during the opening session of the Summit, on 24 September. Current plans for the Summit’s programme and modalities are describedhere.Tackling plastic pollution and specifically marine plastic litter has been a focus of recent initiatives by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) (e.g. inApril 2018andMarch 2019),UNGA President Espinosaand theG20 under Japan’s presidency, amongmanyother actors.

"The Sustainable Development Solutions Network’s (SDSN) data project launched a report on using gridded population data to ensure no one is left behind. The TReNDS authors note that such data are already available, and if properly understood and used, they can help fulfill the SDGs by improving the availability, consistency, and spatial disaggregation of SDG indicators, by helping national and international initiatives to better target their efforts to achieve the SDGs, and by identifying and locating those who might otherwise be left behind.The report titled,Leaving No One Off The Map: A Guide For Gridded Population Data For Sustainable Development, was launched on 13 May 2020.Gridded population data sets combine census results with geospatial and other satellite data, and distribute the data using grid cells. TReNDS notes that gridded population data have emerged as an important resource for delivering actionable data for responding to disasters and monitoring health and infectious diseases. The report aims to improve the accessibility and understanding of gridded population datasets for policymakers and others by showing how gridded population data can supplement current population data sources and help users make informed decisions.For example, the World Food Programme (WFP) uses gridded population data to estimate near real-time impacts of earthquakes and tropical storms on people and infrastructure. The authors explain, “we need to know where people are located, what conditions they are facing, what infrastructure is available, and what basic services they can access.” Another application of gridded population data is to obtain information despite the delays to census operations in countries around the world due to COVID-19.The report also aims to help users identify which gridded population dataset will be most suitable for their particular use. The authors compare seven such data sets from the POPGRID Data Collaborative.The report and its executive summary are available in English, French, and Spanish. Avideoprovides an overview of the report’s messages.On 19 May, SDSN TReNDS will hold a virtual debate on the use of gridded population data in crisis response efforts including COVID-19.

"23 September 2019: An alliance of the world’s largest pension funds and insurers committed to achieve carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050. Participating pension funds and insurers launched the UN-convened ‘Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance’ at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.Allianz, Caisse des Dépôts, La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), Folksam Group, PensionDanmark and Swiss Re initiated the Alliance at the beginning of 2019. Alecta, AMF, CalPERS, Nordea Life and Pension, Storebrand and Zurich have now joined as founding members. The Alliance brings together pension funds and insurers that are responsible for directing over USD 2.4 trillion in investments. These asset owners represent some of the largest pools of capital in the world and typically have highly diversified investment portfolios that are exposed to all sectors of the global economy.Investors in the Alliance are listening to science and moving us to a path of resilience and sustainability.Allianz’s CEO, Oliver Bäte, recognized climate change mitigation as “the challenge of our lifetime,” and said business and societies around the world “need to act as one to rapidly reduce climate emissions.” Bäte said as asset owners “will live up to [their] responsibility” and, in dialogue with the companies in which they invest, “steer towards low-carbon business practices.” He stressed that efforts are already underway and asset owners will achieve climate-neutral portfolios by 2050.CDPQ CEO, Michael Sabia, said there are “many opportunities to earn commercial returns by investing in low-carbon solutions” and working with portfolio companies to decarbonize. He emphasized that investors’ actions can play an important role in fostering the needed energy transition and inducing “real change in every sector.”Alliance members have already begun engaging with companies to ensure that they decarbonize their business models and transition investment portfolios towards net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Members will hold themselves accountable by setting and publicly reporting on targets that are aligned with Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which requires Parties to communicate Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years. The Alliance will collaborate with other initiatives in its efforts to mobilize corporations to commit to net zero emissions, including the 2050 Ambition Alliance, Investor Agenda, Climate Action 100+ and the Science Based Targets initiative.The UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment convene the Alliance as part of the Mission 2020 campaign, led by former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen applauded the leadership of the investors in the Alliance.

Included in five decisions adopted through this procedure on 21 and 22 July were agreements setting out the virtual and in-person modalities for the high-level general debate, set to take place in September.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a decision titled, ‘High-level meetings of the General Assembly in September 2020’ (A/74/L.75), calls for UN Member States, observer States and the European Union to submit pre-recorded statements by Heads of State, Vice-Presidents, Crown Princes or Princesses, Heads of Government, Ministers or Vice-Ministers. These statements will be played in the General Assembly Hall during the general debate, following an introduction by their representative who will be physically present in the Assembly Hall.The decision also indicates that these arrangements will also apply to several events that were scheduled to take place during the opening week of the UNGA’s 75th session: thehigh-level meetingto commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary, thesummit on biodiversity, ahigh-level meetingon the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, and a high-level plenary meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.The decision changed the date for the summit on biodiversity. It will now take place on 30 September 2020, rather than the originally anticipated dates of 22-23 September. Likewise, the date for the high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women has been changed, from 23 September to 1 October 2020. And the high-level plenary meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons will take place on 2 October 2020, rather than 26 September.Through a decision titled, ‘Extension of the procedure for taking decisions of the General Assembly during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic until the end of August 2020’ (A/74/L.76), the UNGA agreed to extend its use of the silence procedure.

"Four hundred and sixty civil society organizations from 115 countries sent a joint letter to UN Member States regarding the need for meaningful civil society participation in the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). With the 2020 HLPF expected to take place in a virtual format, the letter calls for “inclusive virtual modalities” to support effective stakeholder involvement.Theletterexplains that “HLPF processes derive strength from the engagement of diverse actors,” and civil society participation is key to implementing the SDGs. It recalls that in April 2020, UN Secretary-General António Guterres underlined the importance of promoting and protecting civic space in response to COVID-19.Regarding the voluntary national review (VNR), the signatories call on UN Member States and UN agencies to:Allow for at least three responses from Major Groups and Other Stakeholders as part of each VNR presentation;Publish all “shadow” VNR reports from civil society on the UN’s official HLPF website; andEnsure that written questions are answered within a month of the HLPF, if time does not allow during the VNR session.The 2020 HLPF is expected to include VNR presentations from47 national governments.Other recommendations include listing civil society-led side events in the UN’s official programme of side events, and prioritizing voices from national civil society groups for inclusion in the HLPF. The signatories also note that an enabling environment to support diverse stakeholder involvement must account for digital divides.Also in preparation for the 2020 HLPF, the executive summaries of contributions from 15 stakeholder groups have been compiled and released inadvance unedited formon the HLPF website. They have been submitted from: women; children and youth; NGOs; local authorities; workers and trade unions; education and academia; business and industry; persons with disabilities; volunteers; the stakeholder group on ageing; Asia-Pacific regional civil society organizations; Together 2030; LGBTI; the Sendai Group on disaster risk reduction; and the scientific and technological community.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has issued an information note outlining where and how trade costs may increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report highlights transport and travel as having the most significant singular impact on international trade during the pandemic.Published on 12 August 2020, the report titled, ‘Trade Costs in the Time of Global Pandemic,’ identifies three major sources of increased trade costs in the COVID era: transport and travel; trade policy; and uncertainty. Other determinants of trade costs identified in the report include information and transaction costs, information and communication technology (ICT) connectedness, and governance quality.Transport and travel, the authors note, accounts for an estimated 15-31% of trade costs by sector – 15% in agriculture, 31% in manufacturing – and has been seriously impacted by actions taken in response to COVID-19. Travel restrictions and border closures, for example, have directly affected trade in goods and services. These types of restrictions, the report emphasizes, will constitute a substantial increase in trade costs as long as they remain in place. Impacts extend to both land and maritime shipping, and include major disruptions to air cargo capacity, which, the WTO notes, decreased by nearly 25% in March 2020.Trade policy barriers and regulatory differences also represent a significant portion of costs across sectors, accounting for approximately 10% of total trade costs in each. These barriers include tariff and non-tariff measures, temporary actions, and the costs of crossing borders, among other policies that impact trade, such as intellectual property protection. The report notes that, despite several trade facilitating measures aimed at ensuring provision of personal protective equipment and other medical equipment, essential supply shortages due to COVID-19 prompted many governments to impose export-restrictive measures.General uncertainty and risk aversion have amplified trade costs during the pandemic. The report underscores firms’ reduced appetites to invest in new trade relationships – as seen in recent financial and geopolitical crises – as well as reduced availability of trade finance (see SDG Knowledge Hub coveragehereandhere), each of which stand to have a disproportionate impact on developing and emerging economies.The WTO concludes that changes in trade costs are “expected to revert once the pandemic is under control,” but cautions that policy shifts and market dynamics may cause continued disruption. The report identifies selective government-imposed travel and air restrictions and reduced airline competition as potentially causing higher trade costs, to persist until the virus has been eliminated.

"30 September 2019: Israel and Bangladesh have adopted laws to address lead in paint, bringing the total number of countries with legally binding controls to limit the production, import and sale of lead paints to 73.Israel has set a 90 ppm lead limit for all paints, while Bangladesh has established a 90 ppm lead limit for decorative paints. Lead can be found in decorative paint for interiors and exteriors of homes, schools, public and commercial buildings, as well as on toys, furniture and playgrounds.An increasing number of countries are taking steps to eliminate lead paint, in part as a result of recent regional workshops aimed at building support for phasing out lead in paint, underscoring the need for effective laws, promoting regulatory action by governments and raising awareness on theLead in Paint Componentof a Global Environment Facility (GEF)-supported project on ‘Global Best Practices on Emerging Chemical Policy Issues of Concern Under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM).’The most effective means of preventing lead exposure from paints is to establish national laws, including legislation, regulations and/or legally binding standards that ban the use of lead additives in paints. At a minimum, countries are called on to stop the manufacture, import and sale of household decorative lead paints, and to consider limiting lead in all types of paints.To combat lead poisoning and use, the Lead in Paint Component of the SAICM/GEF Project promotes regulatory and voluntary action by government and industry to phase out lead in paint. The project was launched in January 2019 during aninception workshopin Geneva, Switzerland, and will run through 2021.In addition, theGlobal Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paintaims to prevent exposure to lead, promote the phase out of paints containing lead, and seeks to ensure that all countries have lead paint laws in place by 2020. The Alliance is a voluntary partnership established by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).Lead-containing paint is one of the major sources of lead exposure for children globally, and was identified as an Emerging Policy Issue by SAICM. Lead poisoning causes intellectual disabilities in approximately 600,000 children every year and can have lifelong health impacts. No known level of lead exposure is considered safe for adults or children.

"The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Chemical Dialogue hosted a discussion on the 2020-2023 strategic framework for the region. The Chemical Dialogue is the main forum for the chemical industry in Asia and the Pacific, which represents more than 45% of global chemical manufacturing – approximately 7% of global gross domestic product (GDP) – and over 69% of global jobs in the chemical industry.According to the Chemical Dialogue secretariat, the industry plays a critical role in producing supplies to fight COVID-19, including masks, other personal protective equipment (PPE), and hand sanitizer.The plenary meeting convened online from 5-6 November 2020 to discuss updating the APEC Chemical Dialogue Strategic Framework 2020-2023. The framework: integrates health, environmental, and sustainable development considerations related to sound chemicals management; reflects the chemical industry’s commitment to health and safety and to mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific region by providing essential materials required to fight the pandemic; and articulates the Chemical Dialogue’s primary goals. These goals are:facilitating trade and raising the standard of sound chemicals management by expanding and supporting regulatory cooperation and alignment in the region;promoting understanding of the chemical industry’s role as a provider of innovative solutions for sustainable economic, environmental and social development; andenabling effective cooperation between industry and governments to improve chemical product stewardship and safe use.The Framework will guide the Dialogue’s priorities and actions through four working groups on: Regulatory Cooperation and Convergence; the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS); Marine Debris, a cross-cutting initiative to promote development of and investment in innovative solutions to land-based waste management; and Data Exchange, which enables the sharing of data and information on chemicals management.In 2000, APEC ministers welcomed an initiative to establish the Chemical Dialogue. It focuses on challenges imposed by different approaches to regulation, including the difficulty of balancing the protection of trade secrets and confidential information with the need for transparency, facilitating data exchange, and the varying regulatory approaches to the treatment of chemicals. The APEC Chemical Dialogue also emphasizes the integration of its work with the international chemicals agenda.

"28 August 2019: UN-Water and the World Health Organization (WHO) launched their bi-annual Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) report, which surveys 115 countries and territories, representing a total of 4.5 billion people. The report finds that water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors often lack the funds and staffing to fully implement their plans, with fewer than 14% of countries stating that they already have the resources they need, and others reporting funding gaps of up to 60%.The 121-page report, titled ‘National Systems to Support Drinking-Water Sanitation and Hygiene – Global Status Report 2019,’ focuses on governance, monitoring, human resources and finances for WASH, and especially on national policies, plans and targets. The report finds that most countries have WASH policies and implementation plans, but also lack the resources to fully carry out those plans. It shows that built infrastructure is only part of the equation for WASH, and that institutional, governance and financial management systems are also greatly needed.Built infrastructure is only part of the equation for WASH; institutional, governance and financial management systems are also greatly needed.The GLAAS report enables analysis of countries’ achievements towards the WASH targets in the SDGs (target 6.1 on drinking water and target 6.2 on hygiene), as well as on stakeholder participation in WASH (target 6.b). Key statistics from the 2019 report are highlighted in a series ofinfographics, available separately from the report. The report is also accompanied by a set ofcase studieson policy and planning frameworks for sanitation in seven countries: Bangladesh, Kenya, Mali, Nepal, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia. The African country studies are being used to develop Africa Sanitation Policy Guidelines, led by the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW).At World Water Week, held from 25-30 August in Stockholm, Sweden, WHO and UN-Water called for urgently increasing investment in WASH systems. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, highlighted the benefits of water and sanitation systems, not only for health, but also for building “stable, secure, and prosperous societies.” Gilbert Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), emphasized the need to strengthen national delivery systems.

"Coalitions of civil society groups active on the SDGs in countries around the world have scored the progress on each SDG within their country. The “people’s scorecard” model was introduced to enable comparative analysis at the fifth anniversary of the SDGs’ adoption, to assess SDG progress in 20 countries.Progress on each goal is rated from 1 (no progress) to 5 (implementation on track), referring to the time period January-July 2020.According to Action for Sustainable Development (A4SD), this analysis represents the first overview by major CSO coalitions of country-level SDG progress.In each country assessed, a national coalition convened stakeholders and held local consultations with community groups.As a key conclusion of the scorecards, the report notes that economic opportunity and fairness emerges as a particular weakness, as none of the related SDGs (Goals 8, 10, and 12) had scores above 3. The authors observe, “this was already highlighted as an issue at the start of the pandemic and is likely to get even worse in coming months.”The scores for poverty eradication (Goal 1) are very low, as are the ratings for education (Goal 4). Movement in the right direction, however, was indicated for gender equality (Goal 5), with many of the coalitions finding progress in that area, in particular in Spain and Mauritania.The authors note that a major level to tackle climate change is Goal 7, but few countries seem to have made significant progress towards affordable and clean energy.

"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the SDG Investors Partnership, TrackInsight, and Conser released a tool to help investors search for exchange traded funds (ETFs) that directly align with the SDGs. The tool aims to help investors identify and invest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs that can support SDG achievement.According to the tool’s webpage, ESG ETFs directly address 11 of the 17 SDGs. More than 200 ETFs, or nearly 41% of total ESG EST assets, directly align with an SDG.The tool displays alignment with SDGs, illustrating coverage by Goal, the number of ETFs aligned with the Goal, and the total investment by Goal. Three SDGs represent the majority of asset alignment: SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 13 (climate action). For SDG 13, for instance, the tool identifies 155 ETFs, totaling USD 49.1 billion.Some SDGs do not yet align with existing ETFs, including SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).Three SDGs align with only one ETF: SDG 2 (zero hunger) aligns with an ETF totaling USD 18 million; SDG 4 (quality education) aligns with an ETF totaling USD 7 million; and SDG 14 (life below water) aligns with an ETF totaling USD 39.3 million.Similarly, two SDGs align with only two ETFs: SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) aligns with two ETFs, totaling USD 57.8 million; and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) aligns with two ETFs, totaling USD 125.7 million.Users can also view ESG ETFs by regions. Europe, with 370, has the most ESG ETFs available. In comparison, there are 161 ESG ETFs in the Americas, and 21 ESG ETFs in APAC, which includes Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan. By clicking on a region, users can view the list of ESG ETFs by country and provider.The tool also offers insights on which ESG strategies work best, common strategies by region, top ESG ETF providers, and top ESG index providers. [TrackInsight Tool Landing Page]",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography have published a study that suggests previous estimates of plastic in the ocean may be “off by five to seven orders of magnitude.” The US National Science Foundation (NSF) provided financial support for the study.The study developed and tested a new method for collecting and counting tiny microplastics in the ocean. They measured mini-microplastics in the guts of salps, a planktonic species that transports carbon and particles from the sea surface to the deep sea. Every salp the researchers examined had ingested plastic.The traditional method for estimating marine microplastics is “likely missing the smallest particles.”The study found much higher concentrations of tiny microplastics in the ocean and suggests that the traditional method for estimating marine microplastics is “likely missing the smallest particles.” The study estimates the ocean contains 8.3 million pieces of mini-microplastics per cubic meter of water. Nearshore samples had higher plastic concentrations than samples from the open ocean.Despite significant interest in microplastics, “we are just beginning to understand the scale and effects of these ocean contaminants” NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences program director, Dan Thornhill, observed. He said the study “demonstrates that marine plastics are far more abundant than anyone realized and can be found potentially everywhere in the ocean,” resulting in consequences for the environment and human health.[News Story] [Publication:Patterns of suspended and salp‐ingested microplastic debris in the North Pacific investigated with epifluorescence microscopy]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"28 September 2019: Seven young people from Plant-for-the-Planet Foundation have released the ‘Plant-for-the-Planet App’, which allows anyone to plant trees around the world with only a few clicks. The App is part of the Trillion Tree Campaign, which is contributing to global reforestation and climate mitigation efforts.The Plant-for-the-Planet Foundation aims to plant 100 million trees by 2030 through a project in the Yucatan-Peninsula. The Foundation realized that 10,000 projects of that size could restore a trillion trees; they therefore focused on sharing their tools with other projects to help scale up reforestation efforts. The app is one result of this effort. The lead developer, Sagar Aryal, who is 24, has been planting trees with Plant-for-the-Planet for more than ten years, as one of 81,000 youth from 73 countries. Aryal said she developed the app with “Wangari Maathai in mind.”UNEP Executive Director, Inger Andersen, said wide-spread restoration “requires us to reach out to large numbers of people, cost-effectively and quickly.”Users can choose to donate to 50 hand-selected reforestation projects from developing countries. The App directs 100% of the money raised to the tree planters and users can see where their donated trees were planted and gift donated trees to others. In the future, the team plans to add additional reforestation projects to the App. Over 10,000 people signed up to the App in its development phase.Wangari Maathai and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) launched Plant-for-the-Planet in January 2007, as part of the Billion Tree Campaign, which has now transformed into the Trillion Tree Campaign. UNEP Executive Director, Inger Andersen, said wide-spread restoration “requires us to reach out to large numbers of people, cost-effectively and quickly.” She said Apps like Plant-for-the-Planet can “go a long way in boosting nature-based solutions for climate action, livelihoods and sustainability.”The 2.0 version will include a feature that enables users to watch donated forests grow using satellite images.

"A side event, held during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, shared lessons learned from implementing the Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) programme in Colombia, Guatemala and Uruguay, and underscored the need to consider the land, agriculture and forestry nexus.The event took place on 5 December, and was titled, ‘Agriculture and Land Use Sectors in Latin American and Caribbean NDCs: Identifying Gaps in Mitigation and Adaptation Policies, and Promoting Participative Solutions.’ It was organized by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).Enzo Benech, Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, Uruguay, said 80% of his country’s income comes from the production and export of food and commodities, noting that any climate impacts on agriculture are felt across the economy. He lamented that Uruguay has been “vilified” due to the cattle per capita ratio, and called for more dialogue to understand differing national priorities.Paula Andrea Zuleta Gil, Director, Financing and Agricultural Risk, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Colombia, described: local, multi-stakeholder technical agroclimatic committees that are addressing emissions from farming; a rigorous process that resulted in consensus recommendations for each crop; and an innovative agriculture insurance scheme for small-scale coffee farmers. She said her country’s NAP-Ag will focus on risk management, sustainable agriculture, agriculture and livestock resilience, low-carbon policies, and institutional integration.Panelists also mentioned,inter alia:a loss and damage component in Uruguay’s NAP and the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation process;an Earth Security Group report, ‘Financing Sustainable Rice for a Secure Future,’ which describes innovative finance partnerships for mitigation and adaptation such as a rice bond, which could help rice processors, traders and retailers provide farmers with capital to transition to sustainable agriculture, improve resilience and boost yields; andintegration of traditional knowledge into implementation of Guatemala’s NAP.The NAP-Ag programme, a multi-year initiative funded by the Government of Germany, supports partner countries to identify and integrate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector into relevant national planning and budgeting processes.

"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation released the 2020 edition of its Goalkeepers Report, tracking 18 of the SDGs’ global indicators. This year’s report employs novel data collection methods to reveal impacts of COVID-19 on SDG progress in these areas.The Foundation produces a Goalkeepers Report every year, with a plan to do so through 2030 to track progress on the SDGs, highlight successes, and inspire leaders around the world to accelerate their efforts. The latest report, released on 15 September 2020, assesses the state of targets under SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), and 8 (decent work and economic growth).The future is not a zero-sum contest in which winners win only when losers lose.In their introduction, Bill and Melinda Gates note that after years of celebrating forward progress in fighting poverty and disease, this year “we’ve regressed” on the vast majority of the 18 SDG indicators tracked in the report. Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman writes, “As a world, we’ve become used to fewer children dying every year, fewer families struggling to put food on the table, more girls going to school, and more women surviving childbirth. COVID-19 has stopped that progress in its tracks.”The report begins by reviewing the damage being caused by the pandemic. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington generated “contemporary estimates” for the report, using data available through July 2020.Discussing how a collaborative response should look, the authors note that governments are investing ahead of time in large batches of selected vaccine candidates, which they hope will “win” in clinical trials. However, “most will lose.” The authors recommend that countries minimize their risk by investing jointly in a large portfolio of candidates. They should also work together to increase their vaccine manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible.In addition, wealthier governments should work to ensure that the eventual vaccines are made available widely, not only in their respective countries. Otherwise, “they will be extending the life of the pandemic everywhere.” The report cites a finding that twice as many people could die from COVID-19 if “rich countries buy up the first 2 billion doses of vaccine instead of making sure they are distributed in proportion to the global population.”The report concludes that the severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on whether businesses and governments “really believe that the future is not a zero-sum contest in which winners win only when losers lose. It is a cooperative endeavor in which we all make progress together.” [Publication:COVID-19: A Global Perspective: 2020 Goalkeepers Report]",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Trade Centre (ITC), and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) issued the 2020 edition of World Tariff Profiles – a statistical yearbook that provides comprehensive information on the tariffs and non-tariff measures imposed by WTO members and other economies. The “new special topic” for the issue is market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies.The report titled, ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020,’ compiles the main tariff parameters for each of the 164 WTO members, as well as other countries and customs territories where data are available. Each one-page tariff profile contains information on tariffs imposed by each economy on its imports, with disaggregation by sectors and duty ranges, and includes an analysis of the market access conditions each economy faces in its major export markets.The publication features summary tariff and trade statistics for all countries and territories for all products, including a breakdown into agricultural and non-agricultural products, and information on non-tariff measures such as safeguards and anti-dumping measures, which, the report notes, “are of increasing importance in international trade.” Statistics for all countries and territories are presented in standardized tables, which, the report states, allows for easy comparisons between economies, between sectors, and, specifically for WTO members, between bound and applied tariffs.The “special topic,” which presents a new subject in each edition, deals with market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies. The report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic “has highlighted the importance of easy access to affordable medical products” and that shortages of essential products and increased prices “have made it all the more challenging for countries to combat the crisis.” The relevant chapter discusses the bound and applied tariffs for medical products such as medicines and medical technology, critical for the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report, the average tariff applied by WTO members to all medical products is 4.8%, with the highest tariffs (11.5% on average) being applied to personal protective products.

"Speaking at the London School of Economics in April, World Bank President Jim Kim laid out a new strategic direction for development finance: he called on the development community to find win-win outcomes by connecting capital seeking reasonable returns with developing countries’ needs to maximize sustainable investments.This shift in thinking is driven on the one hand by the magnitude of the challenges—from climate change to lack of access to education, health, and sustainable infrastructure —and on the other hand by the realities of the global economy, where yields are low. By acting as honest brokers between capital and development needs, we can turn the challenges into an opportunity for everyone. And we will have a much better chance of achieving theSustainable Development Goals(SDGs)— a set of 17 goals designed to guide international cooperation to achieve sustainable development, end poverty, ensure healthy lives, end hunger, restore terrestrial ecosystems, build resilient infrastructure, promote decent work for all and much more.At the World Bank, we have focused on connecting capital markets to our mission since we were founded. One way we do this is through our funding program. Since 1947, we have issued bonds to raise funds for our lending activities. The funding program grows in step with our lending program; there’s been a steep ramp up since the 2009 financial crisis, and last fiscal year we issued a record US$64 billion in bonds.The value proposition of our bonds to investors is simple and attractive: as a triple-A rated issuer, IBRD has the highest possible credit rating, which reflects its financial strength. Investors know that when they buy our bonds, they are leveraging our 70-year experience of connecting capital markets with projects that improve development outcomes around the world.All IBRD bonds support sustainable development. But we also use our bonds to raise awareness for specific priorities. A good example are green bonds, where issuers raise dedicated funding for climate-friendly investments. IBRD issued the first green bond in 2008 and has since led the development of the market. We have issued over US$10 billion in green bonds.We are now using a similar approach to raise market awareness for the SDGs. In March, we issued SDG-linked bonds—the first bonds that link the return investors receive to the stock performance of 50 companies that are listed in theSolactive Sustainable Development Goals World Indexbecause they support the SDGs in their operations. The bonds raised US$163 million from investors in France and Italy.We developed the bonds in partnership with BNP Paribas, because we need to partner with market players to understand investor needs and opportunities. They are a powerful tool to introduce investors to the SDGs, and they also highlight companies that are supporting them.Clearly, this is only one way to harness markets for development. But there is no question that capital markets can play a key role in promoting sustainability. Looking ahead, we must continue to promote innovation and develop new partnerships to use every financial tool we have to find win-win outcomes for owners of capital and people in developing countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Forty-eight countries are expected to present their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) during the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.In mid-February 2020,51 countrieswere listed for presenting VNRs during the 2020 HLPF. Since then, two first-time presenters (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Bolivia) have rescheduled their presentation to the 2021 HLPF session. Belize was expected to present a second VNR at HLPF 2020, but is no longer on the schedule.Three fewer countries will present VNRs than anticipated, and the updated programme provides for presentations on “building back better after COVID.”The overarching theme for HLPF 2020 is, ‘Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ An updatedschedulefor HLPF 2020, released on 14 May, anticipates that the first three days will consist of presentations on themes related to “building back better after COVID.” VNR presentations will begin on the fourth day of the HLPF, 10 July, and will continue until the final day, 16 July.The Bureau of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is making adjustments to the format and programme of the 2020 session light of the COVID-19 pandemic and expected limitations on in-person meetings and international travel. The UN is exploring technological solutions for virtual sessions and interaction, including for the VNR presentations, due to the fact that any potential physical participation will be limited to New York-based delegates only.

"The Global Environment Facility (GEF) launched a Global E-Mobility Program at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC. The Program will promote and accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles at scale, with the aim of reducing fossil fuel dependency and improving air quality.The Global E-Mobility Program will help governments in 17 countries establish policies to enable technology transfer, access commercial finance and engage the private sector in deploying electric vehicles. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) will implement the Program in partnership with the International Energy Agency (IEA). The GEF has provided an initial USD 33 million for the Program, and aims to leverage over USD 400 million in co-financing, including from the European Commission and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).Without a worldwide switch to a zero-emissions electric fleet, we will not meet the Paris climate targets.UNEP Head of Air Quality and Mobility, Rob de Jong, said theUNEP Emissions Gap Reportand recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports show that “without a worldwide switch to a zero-emissions electric fleet, we will not meet the Paris climate targets.” De Jong stressed the urgency of a global approach to electric mobility, and called on all countries “to start their switch now.” According to the IEA Global EV Outlook 2019, emerging economies could make up approximately 60% of the global electric vehicle fleet by 2030.The Program will create regional platforms in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The platforms will support the transition to electric mobility in the three regions in coordination with the GEF Sustainable Cities Impact Program.The initial countries participating in the Program include Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Burundi, Chile, Costa Rica, India, Côte d’Ivoire, Jamaica, Madagascar, Maldives, Peru, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Saint Lucia, Togo, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.

"On World Water Day, observed annually on 22 March, UN-Water released the 2020 World Water Development Report, which highlights the essential role of water resources as a solution to climate change. The report argues that water can support efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change and that sustainable water resources management is essential to achieving the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.The report, titled ‘The UN World Water Development Report 2020: Water and Climate Change,’ states that climate change will affect the “availability, quality and quantity of water needed for basic human needs” and potentially threaten the human right to water and sanitation for billions of people. Increased water temperatures and decreased dissolved oxygen will affect water quality and contribute to a reduction in the self-purification capacity of freshwater basins. In addition, periods of droughts and floods may exacerbate the concentration of pollution and pathogens in water. Ecosystems, including forests and wetlands, are also likely to be negatively impacted by changes in water quality, resulting in biodiversity loss and negative impacts on the provision of water-related ecosystem services, including carbon capture and storage, natural flood protection and water purification.The report also discusses the challenge of wastewater treatment, which generates an estimated 3-7% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, from the biochemical processes and energy used to treat wastewater. Untreated wastewater is also a source of methane. The report calls for improved wastewater management and suggests that the extraction of methane from organic matter can be used to generate energy needed to run wastewater treatment processes. Water-scarce countries, including Jordan, Mexico, Peru and Thailand, have employed these techniques, resulting in financial savings, improved service quality, and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.The report stresses the need to prioritize water in climate actions and emphasize it as a top priority for adaptation in most nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Although States often mention water in their NDCs’ portfolio of actions, few calculate the costs of these actions and only 10% elaborate on specific projects. The report recommends that States increase opportunities to integrate adaptation and mitigation planning into water-related investments to promote the sustainable management of water resources, the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and to help achieve the SDGs.The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) publishes the World Water Development Report annually on behalf of UN-Water. World Water Day 2020 focused on the linkages between water and climate change.Also, to mark the Day, the CEO Water Mandate launched the Water Resilience Coalition, which will bring together companies from around the world to help preserve freshwater resources. Coalition members will commit to develop and implement water resilience practices across their industry, to provide leadership and advocacy on water resilience, and to contribute to a positive impact in water stressed basins.

Together with local partners, theprojectaims to analyze available data and customize a platform for each country. It draws on national statistics as well as data from the UN, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank, as well as innovative sources including citizen-generated data, satellite data, telcodata and big data.The Goal Tracker is open-access and open source, but each country-specific platform is owned and run by the government in the respective country, usually through its Ministry for Planning and/or National Statistics Office. In addition, local partners receive training in order to take ownership of the work.The Goal Tracker for South Africa was launched on 2 December 2019, at Statistics South Africa in Pretoria, South Africa. Through the portal, SDG data will be publicly available in an interactive, user-friendly format. The Tracker provides also information about South Africa’s national policies related to achieving the SDGs that, paired with the data made available, can offer improved tools for decision-making, resource allocation and enhanced collaboration between all stakeholders in support of the SDGs.According to the project, South Africa has data available for 128 of the 199 SDG indicators, or 64%. The Tracker is to be constantly updated with the most recent data on SDG until 2030. In addition, new features are expected to be developed including tools to visualize non-traditional data, linkages with Agenda 2063 (for African countries) and budgets linked to the SDGs.

"Researchers from the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) have published a global map of food system sustainability, based on two decades of research into scientific literature. The researchers constructed the map using 20 indicators available to 97 low-, middle- and high-income countries.According to CGIAR, the map is the first to provide a worldwide food system sustainability assessment based on a holistic set of indicators. The 20 indicators are divided across four dimensions: environmental, economic, social, and food and nutrition. They cover a range of factors such a greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, the size of the female labor force, fair trade, food price volatility, and food loss and waste. They can be utilized to track changes in sustainability over time and are meant to guide policy related to climate change, demographic changes, and increased demand for food.The map provides “one of the most systematic attempts to date to unpack food system dynamics, from farm to fork to policy.”Steven Prager, one of the co-authors and senior scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), noted that the research represents “a critical step forward” in understanding the relationship between the structure and function of food systems and their sustainability.

"As we mark World Toilet Day and there is more and more discussion about the importance of dealing with human waste, many people will become embarrassed or shocked, and some would rather avoid the subject altogether.However, the sanitation crisis that exists in many parts of the world, and the impact it has on nature, cannot be ignored.A recentUN progress reportshows that with just 12 years until the deadline, we are seriously off track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of sanitation for all by 2030: Today 4.5 billion people live without safely managed sanitation, and 892 million people going to the toilet in the open.[1]Human waste, on a massive scale, is not being captured or treated properly, turning the environment into an open sewer.In streets and fields around people’s homes, human excreta is spreading deadly diseases by contaminating water resources and farmland that communities rely on to survive.So, we must not only build more toilets for those who remain unserved. We must also build more toilets that work in harmony with ecosystems.Nature-based sanitation solutions harness the power of nature to help treat human waste before it returns to the environment.Most nature-based sanitation solutions essentially involve the protection and management of vegetation, soils and wetlands, including rivers and lakes. For instance, composting latrines capture and treat human waste on site, producing a free supply of fertiliser to help grow crops. And human-made wetlands and reed-beds filter contaminants out of wastewater before it is released back into water courses.Technologies like these, that expand coverage of sanitation services at the same time as protecting nature, must be a bigger part of the mix as we work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of toilets for all by 2030.The UN-led campaign ahead of World Toilet Day is titled, ‘When nature calls’; a play on words with a serious meaning. Nature is sending us a message that we must listen to and act upon urgently.Our ecosystems cannot absorb an ever-growing volume of raw faeces. And billions of people cannot cope with the ill-health and indignity caused by ineffective or non-existent sanitation.The sanitation crisis, if allowed to continue, will undermine the overarching ambition of the 2030 agenda: to build safer, more resilient societies on a healthy planet.With just 12 years to go to the 2030 deadline, for the sake of people and the planet, we must redouble our efforts to provide universal access to toilets, leaving no-one behind.By Rolf Luyendijk, Executive Director, UN-hosted Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC), on behalf of the UN-Water 2018 World Toilet Day Task Force[1]WHO/UNICEF (2017):Progress on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene: 2017 update and SDG baselines.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a comprehensive report on sustainable markets that finds that a trend towards certified land is expected to continue, especially if producing countries and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, support sustainability trends. The report shares highlights and trends based on data from 14 major sustainability standards for bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil palm, soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and forestry products.‘The State of Sustainable Markets 2020: Statistics and Emerging Trends,’ provides data on area, production volume, and producers for 14 standard-setting organizations focused on the eight commodities and forestry. The report finds that the certified farmland of most of the eight crops is expanding: between 2014 and 2018, the certified area of all agricultural commodities covered in the report grew by 52%. Cotton has the largest certified area: 18.2% of land cultivated for cotton globally is now certified. Cocoa, oil palm, and coffee represent the crops with the next largest areas of certified land. Commodities with the smallest certified area are soybeans, sugarcane, tea, and bananas. Buyers of most of the eight crops are also making progress in establishing and disclosing sustainable sourcing commitments.Organic represents the biggest sustainability standard for both area and product variety. In 2018, 1.5% of agricultural land worldwide was classified as organic. In forestry, two standards dominate. The forest area certified by Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) continues to exceed the forest area certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC): 7.7% of forest area is PEFC-certified, compared with 4.9% of global forest area certified under FSC.The report highlights the role of consumer preferences for healthier and more sustainably grown products in driving the rising popularity of certified products like bananas, cocoa, and soybeans. At the same time, ITC’s Executive Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton cautions against depending “on consumer sentiment alone” to drive sustainability and certification. Coke-Hamilton recommends engaging with multinational buyers and policymakers to see how they can scale the uptake of sustainability standards across additional goods and countries. Additional driving forces behind growth in sustainability include implementation of risk management strategies by private companies that source commodities from developing countries, and regulatory frameworks that establish commodity sourcing conditions in both producing and consuming countries.On COVID-19, the authors note that the pandemic has increased stress on exporters of the products analyzed in the report. Within this context, the report emphasizes that voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) can help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use more environmentally friendly and socially responsible practices while also improving their competitiveness and differentiating their product offerings.ITC launched this fifth global report at the ITC Good Trade Summit, which took place virtually from 7-8 October on the theme, ‘Emerging Stronger from the COVID-19 Crisis.’ ITC produced the report in collaboration with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), with financial support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. [Publication:The State of Sustainable Markets 2020] [Publication Landing Page] [ITC Press Release] [Good Trade Summit Webpage]",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
"REN21’s ‘Renewables 2020 Global Status Report‘ indicates that, while there has been significant growth over the last five years in renewable energy, it needs to expand beyond the power sector to the heating, cooling, and transport sectors. In its related annual analysis of renewables, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that renewable power is increasingly cheaper than new electricity capacity based on fossil fuels.The annual REN21 GSR report indicates that 2019 saw the largest ever increase in installed power capacity – more than 200 gigawatts – with installed renewable energy capacity by the end of 2019 being enough to provide an estimated 27.3% of global electricity generation.In terms of renewable share of total final energy consumption,key findingsfrom the report indicate that, in 2017:Buildings accounted for 33% of final energy demand, with renewables supplying 13.6% of this demand;Industry accounted for 35% of final energy demand, with renewables supplying 14.5% of this demand; andTransport accounted for 32% of final energy demand, with renewables supplying 3.3% of this demand.The GSR report recommends adopting an integrated approach that includes policies to increase the uptake of renewables, decrease energy use by making energy efficiency mandatory, and accelerate the phase out of fossil fuels.The findings of IRENA’sRenewable Power Generation Costs in 2019indicate that market forces should help to facilitate the first and third of these policy approaches. The IRENA report indicates new solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind power costs less than keeping many existing coal plants in operation. The report suggests that “boosting investment in renewables can align short-term recovery measures with medium and long-term energy and climate sustainability goals.” It further proposes that solar PV and onshore wind be used for rapid roll-out, and offshore wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal technologies be considered for medium-term investment options.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"A report released by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) reviews the extent of stakeholder involvement in SDG implementation, based on the 158 Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) conducted over the past four years. The report was commissioned by DESA’s Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) and authored by the Canadian Council for International Cooperation (CCIC).Approximately 75% of countries consistently noted non-state actors’ inclusion in governance mechanisms.According to the report, titled ‘Multi-stakeholder Engagement in 2030 Agenda Implementation: A review of Voluntary National Review Reports (2016-2019),’ approximately 75% of countries that have presented VNRs to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) consistently noted non-state actors’ inclusion in governance mechanisms. Eighty percent included information on multi-stakeholder engagement to “nationalize” the SDGs and build a sense of local ownership through public meetings, workshops and other means. Reporting on how countries monitor and follow-up on their progress declined from 70% in 2017, to 57% in 2018, to 32% in 2019.The report summarizes gaps and recommended actions for Member States, the UN system and non-state actors. The authors articulate ten lessons in multi-stakeholder engagement, which are bolstered by country experiences showcased as case studies:Plan to engage;Include non-state actors in institutional arrangements for implementation;Create inclusive spaces for ongoing dialogue, collaboration and partnership;Make awareness-raising ongoing, and do it in partnership with others;Continue to consult on priorities and report on progress to citizens according to agreed timetables;Empower citizens to participate in implementation through capacity development, direct support and inclusive partnerships;Engage with diverse groups while respecting representative stakeholder bodies;Take targeted steps to leave no one behind in stakeholder engagement;Recognize the expertise of others; andReport on your experience and the experiences of others that contribute to implementation as part of a whole-of-society approach.Concluding that there a need to improve reporting on multi-stakeholder engagement in VNRs, the report calls for more detailed information on how non-state actors are engaged SDG implementation efforts. The authors call on Member States to utilize the UN Secretary-General’s Voluntary Common Reporting Guidelines and DESA’s handbook for preparing VNRs, to ensure inclusivity in the process and consistency and comparability across countries’ reports.

"ICLEI held a virtual meeting on the occasion of the UN’s 75th anniversary (UN75) to address cities’ central role in climate governance given their high energy consumption and emission levels. Cities are responsible for 70% of global energy consumption and 80% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as participants were reminded by Christoph Heusgen, Permanent Representative of Germany.The meeting convened on 23 October 2020 under the auspices of the Daring Cities Forum. Daring Cities is a series of virtual events aimed at “urban leaders taking on the climate emergency.” It is taking place from 7-28 October 2020.Multilevel cooperation is a logical progression from multilateralism.Speakers discussed the ICLEI Blueprint, a proposal for “multilevel collaboration in the age of inclusive multilateralism,” in the words of Frank Cownie, Mayor of Des Moines, US, and ICLEI Vice President and spokesperson to the UN. Cownie said the Blueprint calls for local and regional governments to be at the heart of the “new UN.” The Blueprint is built on four “cornerstones”:Global engagement through annual high-level consultations with the Chief Executives of the UN System;Regional engagement through increased collaboration between the UN Regional Commissions and UN host cities;National engagement with UN Country Coordinators through national associations; andLocal2030 hubs and local engagement, by mobilizing additional resources to champion local and regional governments engaged in the work of the UN.Yunus Arikan, ICLEI World Secretariat, said the need for multilevel governance is increasingly being recognized within the UN system. Peter Lange, Foreign Federal Office, Germany, added that multilevel cooperation is a logical progression from multilateralism. Stefan Wagner, City of Bonn, stressed the importance of cities’ involvement in multilateral fora, especially the UN. Sabine Drees, Association of German Cities, called for increasing the visibility of sub-national movements.Participants exchanged views on the various roles of a voluntary local review (VLR) of SDG implementation. Maimunah Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, said VLRs are a tool to: facilitate civic engagement in local decision-making; support the mainstreaming of SDGs in local plans and strategies; guide public investments; and facilitate connections and peer learning with other cities and regions. Shipra Narang Suri, UN-Habitat, added that VLRs can mobilize and galvanize action, in addition to being a monitoring tool.Riina Jussila, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said VLRs can also support communication between levels of government. She described VLRs a “new means of SDG implementation.”The meeting included a focus on the City of Bonn, Germany, whichreleasedits first VLR on 6 October 2020. The Mayor of Bonn, ICLEI President Ashok Sridharan, presented the VLR to participants. He said it uses 46 indicators, and is seen as a tool to engage and communicate with stakeholders.Local officials shared insights from Bristol, UK, Catbalogan, Philippines, and Quelimane, Mozambique. Manuel de Araujo, Mayor of Quelimane, said his city was the first in Mozambique to devise a climate adaptation plan and has since shared its experience with other cities in the country.UN-Habitat reported that it is providing guidance to cities on developing their VLRs, beginning with Florence, Italy, and Moscow, Russian Federation.

"14 August 2019: The Government of Guinea has launched a project to strengthen climate monitoring capacity, early warning systems, and information for responding to climate shocks and adaptation planning. The project will contribute to, among others, SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender equality), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land).The project will install more than 100 meteorological and hydrological stations, and data captured will feed into information and forecasts to inform policymakers, government officials and farmers. In addition, the project will train national service managers and officers to: gather and analyze the data; model and produce quality climate information products; and process and archive data. More than 80% of the country’s population are expected to benefit from improved monitoring and response capacities.The project will also integrate adaptation into the policies, planning and budgeting of climate-sensitive sectors, including agriculture, livestock, water, and coastal and forestry areas, and involve women and girls, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other beneficiary communities.The project consists of two components. The technology transfer for monitoring climate and environmental infrastructure component aims to strengthen the capacities of national hydrometeorological departments in monitoring extreme weather phenomena and climate change. Outputs include, among others, establishing a centralized national climate data and hazard information center and knowledge management system. The second component involves integrating climate information, early warning and climate adaptation products into development plans, with the aim of ensuring that climate products and services are accessible and used efficiently and effectively to produce warnings for producers of medium- and long-term climate-resilient development plans. Outputs include, among others: risk profiles and maps for,inter alia, extreme weather events and diseases; a multi-hazard early warning system; and a financial sustainability strategy for the early warning system.The four-year project (2019-2023) will feed into national and global priorities, includingGuinea’s National Economic and Social Development Plan 2016-2020,Vision Guinée 2040, Guinea’sNational Adaptation Programme of Action (2007)and the country’s 2015 intendedNationally Determined Contribution(NDC).The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Transport through the National Directorate of Meteorology, with USD 5.35 million from the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP).

"Parties to the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted a guidance document on integrated sustainable nitrogen management, aiming to address the pollution problems that nitrogen causes in the global biosphere.The Executive Body of the Convention adopted the guidance on 18 December 2020. It aims to help governments and farmers reduce nitrogen waste into air and water and keep more nitrogen on farms, where it can bring benefits for food production, the economy, the environment, and human health.Because better nitrogen management would yield multiple co-benefits, it is a way to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs within the SDGs.The Guidance identifies co-benefits of controlling air pollution in the areas of climate, water, biodiversity, health, and the economy. It also identifies 24 principles to help Parties understand and tailor solutions.UNECE reports that human activities over the last century have more than doubled the total amount of nitrogen introduced into the global biosphere. The resulting problems include air pollution, water pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, stratospheric ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, and soil acidification.The lead author of the guidance, Mark Sutton, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said the Guidance brings together, for the first time, nitrogen losses relevant for air, climate, and water. Through this integrated approach, he argues that “with sound nitrogen management, not only will air and water quality benefit, but it’ll help mitigate climate change as well.”Sutton said that because better nitrogen management would yield multiple co-benefits, it is a way to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs within the SDGs.

"12 July 2019: Transparency International (TI) has suggested that SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) should be reviewed every year. To date, only one of the SDGs, Goal 17 on partnerships, is reviewed annually at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The organization also calls on the UN to set “concrete, advanced indicators” to measure progress on SDG 16.SDG target 16.4 addresses illicit financial flows, while target 16.5 pledges to reduce corruption and bribery “in all their forms,” and target 16.6 seeks to develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels.TI argues that fighting corruption is essential to eradicating poverty (SDG 1), ending hunger (SDG 2), ensuring access to health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4) and clean water (SDG 6), protecting marine environments (SDG 14) and taking climate action (SDG 13). The organization cites UN figures indicating that corruption, bribery, tax evasion and illicit financial flows cost developing countries around USD 1.26 trillion a year. In the area of taxation alone, TI highlights International Monetary Fund (IMF) statistics that show corruption reduces global tax revenues by USD 1 trillion every year.TI is a global movement against corruption, with an international secretariat in Berlin, Germany, and chapters in more than 100 countries. In apress release, Delia Ferreira Rubio, TI Chair, underlines that citizens must be able to hold governments to account over delivery of essential services.To promote consideration of its proposal, TI organized a side event on 12 July 2019 in New York, US, in conjunction with the HLPF, on the theme of ‘Multi-stakeholder perspectives on the implementation of SDG 16.’ [TI Information Page]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"12 July 2019: An event on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) addressed opportunities and challenges regarding the digital revolution and sustainable development. The side event was presented by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and The World in 2050 (TWI2050) research initiative.The 12 July event in New York, US affirmed that: the digital revolution is a driving force of societal transformation; references to digitalization are lacking in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change; and transformation towards sustainability must be harmonized with the threats, opportunities and dynamics of the digital revolution, the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.Panelists highlighted that data-driven interdisciplinarity and development of national data platforms, such as theAfrican Open Science Platform, are priorities for greater synergies between digitization and the SDGs. Speakers emphasized ways in which digitization could help support a green economy, calling for technologies that support measuring and monitoring the Global Goals.The event also highlighted areportreleased by TWI2050 titled, ‘Digital Revolution and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges,’ which describes the ways in which digitalization can transform the world. The report aims to bridge the gaps between digitization and sustainability, and outlines six transformation areas:human capacity and demography through further improvements of education and health care;responsible consumption and production through the adoption of a circular economy approach and reducing demand;decarbonization of energy systems through energy efficiency, more renewables and electrification;more efficient and sustainable food systems by increasing agricultural productivity and access to nutritional food and clean water, while protecting the biosphere and oceans;smart cities development through smart infrastructure, decent housing and high connectivity; andthe digital revolution as a sustainable development driver.The event also highlighted challenges related to digitalization that may have unsustainable effects related to structural unemployment and proliferation of autonomous weapons. In the ensuing debate, participants highlighted concerns regarding the speed of technological disruption, as well as the “digital divide” as it contributes to social inequalities.

"15 June 2019: The 13th Annual Meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Creative Cities Network (UCCN) brought together UCCN mayors under the theme, ‘The Ideal City.’ Mayors renewed their commitment to building on the impact of culture, creativity, cooperation and innovation to foster sustainable cities and communities in line with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).Conclusions from the meeting, which convened in Fabriano, Italy, from 10-15 June 2019, underscore the UCCN’s mission to build on culture and creativity for sustainable development, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. UCCN mayors recommend the development of a long-term strategy for the Network’s governance and sustainability that should focus on “demonstrating and measuring impact and achievements for sustainable development at the local, national and international levels in the spirit of” the 2030 Agenda.Creative Cities are emerging as hubs of experimentation that lead to innovative and successful models of sustainable development.At the gathering, the mayors stressed the cross-cutting contribution of culture to achieving the SDGs. They shared examples of how their cities are addressing community needs by building on culture and creativity to develop innovative and inclusive urban strategies, and explored the role of culture across development areas such as education, inclusiveness, environment and economic growth.The meeting also shared the first publication of the UCCN LAB.2030 Initiative titled, ‘Voices of the City: UNESCO Creative Cities Moving Towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ which discusses the diverse ways in which the Creative Cities embrace culture in their local policies to achieve the 2030 Agenda.According to a UCCN press release, “Creative Cities are emerging as hubs of experimentation that lead to innovative and successful models of sustainable development.” Cities of Literature, for example, aim to ensure freedom of expression and literacy for all, while fostering multilingual environments, in line with SDG 4 (quality education). Cities of Gastronomy are promoting SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). Cities of Film and of Music provide spaces for promoting human rights, equality and solidarity, contributing to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 10 (reduced inequalities) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). Cities of Design seek to reinvent housing, public spaces, access and mobility and to stimulate social innovation and global citizenship, helping achieve SDGs 4 and 11. Cities of Crafts and Folk Art and Cities of Media Arts enhance the diversity of cultural expressions and safeguard community practices, and promote contemporary urban narratives and space for cultural expression with new technologies, respectively.Launched in 2004, the UCCN comprises 180 cities from five continents, and focuses on seven creative fields: crafts and folk arts; design; film; gastronomy; literature; media arts; and music.

"The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has published a report that recommends grouping chemicals to speed up regulatory action to better manage their risks.ECHA’s secondAnnual Report on Integrated Regulatory Strategy, published in May 2020, provides an overview of progress made in addressing substances of concern and in mapping all registered substances or ‘mapping the chemical universe.’ It includes recommendations for consideration by authorities and industry on managing chemical risks.In 2019, ECHA moved from a substance-by-substance approach to addressing structurally similar chemicals in groups in an effort to accelerate the identification of hazardous substances and manage their risks. That same year, the Agency, together with national authorities, reviewed around 220 high-volume substances registered above 100 tonnes per year and allocated them to different pools of the chemical universe for regulatory action. 56% required more hazard data to clarify the need for further risk management, 22% required no further action, and 7% were considered high priority for EU regulatory risk management.Overall, the chemical universe of over 21,000 registered substances included, as of August 2019, around: 330 substances with regulatory risk management under consideration; 1,550 substances under data generation; 390 substances with ongoing regulatory risk management; and 700 substances with no further actions proposed following reviews by authorities. The aim is to have full clarity for all registered substances by 2027.The report overviews pre-regulatory steps, evaluation processes, and regulatory risk management activities under the EU’s REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) regulation. ECHA has an interim goal of generating a sufficient understanding of all substances registered above 100 tonnes by 2020 and assigning each substance to one of the following work streams: high priority for risk management; high priority for data generation; or currently of low priority for further regulatory action.The report recommends:further optimizing screening groups of substances, data generation and assessment to ensure substances are subject to regulatory risk management;prioritizing harmonized classification and labeling;reviewing the priority and appropriateness of previously identified, but still pending, follow-up actions and advancing those substances that need further regulatory risk management without delay;improving the compliance of registration information, particularly for substances with a high potential for exposure and lacking appropriate hazard data; andfurther enhancing cooperation and coordination between authorities.The report also underscores that industry is responsible for compliance of dossiers, their systematic review and updates of registrations based on new information. It states that ECHA welcomes the initiative of industry associations to develop review programmes to help registrants review chemical safety data. [ECHA Press Release]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"2 September 2019: Delegates to the third meeting of the Intersessional Process Considering the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020 (IP3) are considering a paper on issues of concern developed by the Co-Chairs of the IP.The document (SAICM/IP.3/4), submitted in advance of the IP3, which is meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, from 30 September to 4 October 2019, includes the Co-Chairs’ proposed text on the definition, criteria and possible modalities for adopting issues of concern, and describes the background and considerations behind the text. Participants are expected to review the text and further develop it as an IP3 output.The text details suggested criteria for issues of concern, which relate to,inter alia: potential impact on human health or the environment, taking into account vulnerable subpopulations, ecosystems, and toxicological and exposure data gaps; the extent to which the issue is being successfully addressed by other bodies; and the extent to which the issue is relevant across regions.Proposed text on mechanisms for adopting issues of concern and for monitoring their progress addresses: identification, nomination, selection, review and prioritization; implementation mechanisms; tracking progress, including monitoring and reporting against milestones; criteria for completion or sunsetting an issue; and accelerating progress on an issue.The text notes that SAICM should continue to provide a forum for open discussion and information exchange by all stakeholders and to promote collaborative action. It further notes that once an initial set of issues of concern is established, any proposal to take on other issues will trigger a review of the relative importance of all issues that may determine the termination of one or more issues of concern as necessary to ensure priority issues are addressed and that overall capacity/resources to take on new issues has not been exceeded.The proposed text also identifies the need to distinguish between issues which primarily need capacity-building support at a national or regional level and those where collective action is required.IP3 is expected to develop recommendations for consideration by the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) related to: targets, milestones and indicators; institutional arrangements; mechanisms to support implementation; and financial considerations.The ‘Beyond 2020’ process was launched in Brasilia, Brazil, in 2017, and aims to create a new and enhanced platform to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, as well as consider the broader pollution agenda.

"A technical brief from the UN Population Fund sheds light on how a disease outbreak can have different impacts on women and men. It highlights that sexual and reproductive health and rights are a significant public health issue, and require high attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.The brief titled, ‘COVID-19: A Gender Lens: Protecting sexual and reproductive health and rights, and promoting gender equality,’ was released on 19 March 2020. It notes that in times of crisis, increased household tensions can increase the risk of domestic violence. At the same time, the systems for protecting women and girls may weaken or break down.With schools closed around the world, girls are more exposed to sexual violence and unwanted pregnancy.With schools around the world closed during the pandemic, the technical brief notes that girls are more exposed to sexual violence and unwanted pregnancy, based on experiences in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016. In Sierra Leone, schools closed for nine months, and the country saw a spike of 18,000 teenage pregnancies. Many of the girls were then banned from attending school when it reopened, leading some to miss university entrance exams.An expert from Equality Nowsaidthe majority of these teenagers “were violated in the context of the Ebola virus quarantine. People were told to stay home, and many girls were violated by their relatives and neighbors and people they knew.”On sexual and reproductive health, services and resources may be diverted to deal with the outbreak, which can lead to outcomes such as increased maternal and newborn mortality, increased unmet need for contraception, and increased number of unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted infections. In addition, supply chain strains due to the pandemic can affect services and commodities for menstrual health and other aspects of sexual and reproductive health.The authors also note that women’s “front-line interaction with communities and their participation in much of the care work” heightens their risk of exposure. At the same time, their proximity to the community makes women “well placed to positively influence the design and implementation of prevention activities and community engagement.” [UNFPA press release] [Publication:COVID-19: A gender lens: Protecting sexual and reproductive health and rights, and promoting gender equality]",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The 2019 ‘Panorama of Food and Nutritional Security for Latin America and the Caribbean’ shows that, since 1975, adult obesity in Latin America and the Caribbean region has tripled, while one in four are going hungry. The rates of childhood and adolescent obesity also tripled between 1990 and 2016, and every year, 600,000 people in the region die from diet-related diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.The publication, which was launched on 12 November 2019, by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), calls on governments to take urgent action to address malnutrition across the region, indicating that the 24% obesity rate in the region is almost double the global level of 13.2%.Ultra-processed food products are the fastest growing food trend in the region.The report notes that ultra-processed food products represent the fastest growing trend in the region’s food sector, exposing the population to excessive amounts of sugar, sodium and fat. It explains how the domination of food processing industries in the region increases the availability of ultra-processed products in supermarkets, and how when affordability outweighs nutrition, the poor suffer the most.The publication recommends a series of measures for promoting healthier food environments. They include:using taxation and other incentives that favor healthy foods;strengthening social protection systems;expanding school feeding programmes;regulating food advertising and marketing;improving food labeling;ensuring the safety and quality of food sold on the street; andreformulating the ingredients of certain products to ensure nutritional value.The Panorama of Food and Nutritional Security 2019 also calls for political leadership to stem obesity in the region, noting that at least 13 countries in the region have taken measures in support of adequate food, eight have improved advertising regulations, and four have implemented food labeling laws. In the SDG on zero hunger (SDG 2), target 2.2 calls for ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030.

"The UN Global Compact held the inaugural Ocean Stewardship Annual Review, aiming to identify critical actions for the ocean to support the Decade of Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The Ocean Stewardship Annual Review brought together more than 50 CEOs, policymakers, and civil society leaders for a high-level meeting on 21 September 2020, on the sidelines of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). The event underscored that accelerating ocean-based solutions can support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and delivery of the SDGs.According to the UN Global Compact’sOcean Stewardship 2030 reportreleased in May 2020, fivetipping pointscould secure a healthy and productive ocean. These are:Fully traceable sustainable seafood;Decarbonized shipping (“set sail for zero”);Harnessing ocean electricity;Mapping the ocean; andEnding waste entering the ocean.During the review event, five CEO Roundtables addressed these tipping points. The review resulted in anOutcome Document of the 2020 CEO Roundtables on Ocean, identifying actions business can take to advance the five areas. On sustainable seafood, the outcome document recommends: contributing to standardize traceability data, harmonize standards and promote interoperability of traceability platforms through the seafood value chain; and increasing the recognition of seafood in the climate and food agendas.On decarbonizing shipping, recommendations include: providing incentives to develop and scale up low- or zero-carbon fuels, and support transparency and financial capacity; engaging with governments and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in setting up a global research and development fund and calling for further policy action; and sharing best practices regarding technology for zero-emission vessels.On harnessing ocean energy, the document highlights action areas related to: developing a framework for global strategic planning by governments, in dialogue with relevant stakeholders; and increasing standardization of the industry and setting up global certifications and key performance indicators.On ending waste entering the ocean, the document calls for: defining the “rules of the game” such as through dependable regulations for the private sector, to facilitate greater public-private collaboration to end ocean plastic; and determining the institutions needed to rapidly scale plastic pollution solutions across countries, as well as funding them.On mapping the ocean, the outcome document recommends: conducting a gap analysis to take stock of ongoing ocean data initiatives, and data and information needs; and identifying enabling factors and the necessary means to implement them, including support for developing countries, in collecting, sharing, and using ocean data.On delivering on the Decade of Action, participants identified barriers and actions for business and governments to realize the ambitions highlighted in the Ocean Stewardship 2030 report. SDG 14 (life below water) addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Four of the targets of SDG 14 are due to be achieved by 2020. [UN Global Compact webpage on ocean action]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1
"An event that convened during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, highlighted adaptation actions with mitigation co-benefits.Organized by Qatar’s Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME) and titled, ‘Adaptation Actions with Mitigation Co-Benefits and Economic Diversification,’ participants discussed actions that provide mitigation co-benefits as well as modalities and procedures for assessing adaptation, for which there is currently a lack of consensus.Axel Michaelowa, Founder, Perspective Climate Group, presented methodologies for assessing mitigation co-benefits, stating that the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a useful starting point for developing such methodologies. Gareth Phillips, Manager, Climate Change and Environment Finance Division, African Development Bank (AfDB), presented the Bank’s Adaptation Benefit Mechanism for mobilizing public and private sector adaptation funding.Abdulrahim Al Muftah, Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, discussed preparations for the FIFA 2022 World Cup, highlighting proposed sustainability and carbon neutrality measures. He said that the Global Carbon Trust is supporting World Cup preparations and operations to develop assessment standards to measure carbon reduction, implement carbon reduction projects, and issue carbon credits to offset emissions.Participants also called attention to, among other issues: the Energy Savings and Performance Award launched to recognize stakeholders and contractors who implement energy-saving strategies in their various fields of operations at Hamad International Airport (HIA) in Qatar; the Energy Savings Awareness Initiative encouraging HIA staff members to conserve electricity; MME efforts to implement the first NDC report, in collaboration with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), which included sections on the Qatari climate situation and adaptation actions with mitigation co-benefits; and the role of insurance for adaptation in developing countries.The event took place on 6 December 2019.

"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) have launched the Climate Action Platform on Agriculture (PLACA). The Platform aims to support joint solutions in the agriculture sector in the LAC region, including climate adaptation and mitigation practices, and promoting the joint formulation of more ambitious goals for reflection in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change.The initiative, led by the Government of Chile, was launched on 5 December 2019, at the UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 25) in Madrid, Spain.PLACA is a voluntary membership platform. To date, the Governments of Argentina, the Bahamas, Brazil, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay have signed on.During the launch, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena said that in the arena of agriculture, climate action means nature-based solutions, bioeconomy, linking with the biodiversity and desertification agendas, and science-policy dialogue. The region faces significant agriculture-related challenges that make it particularly vulnerable to climate change, namely: achieving food security for its population and ensuring large-scale food production for other regions of the world.The next steps in the Platform’s implementation include detailed socialization with all countries in the region, capacity-building processes, and the development of monitoring and evaluation tools and mechanisms.The process of building the platform began in 2012 with ECLAC and FAO support to the climate negotiations in the forestry and agriculture sectors.

"12 July 2019: The UN’s Interagency Task Force on Financing for Development (FfD) held a discussion on the findings of its 2019 Financing for Sustainable Development Report (FSDR). Meeting on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), speakers drew attention to technology, data and digital finance, which will be in focus in the 2020 edition of the report.Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said financing remains a major bottleneck to implementing the SDGs and the financing for development (FfD) agenda. Navid Hanif, DESA, added that financing is about more than money; policy choices, capacity building, and technology are also important. The officials said the 2020 edition of the report will focus on disruptive technological change and its impacts on sustainable development.“We still don’t know where the money is going to come from.”Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the UN, said the voices speaking out about financing for sustainable development have grown to an “alarm … that we are this far into the implementation process, and we still don’t know where the money is going to come from.” Elisenda Vives Balmana, Permanent Representative of Andorra, said the2019 FSDRshows the economic benefits for businesses in becoming more climate friendly. She reported that climate change affects tourism, which is an important source of income for Andorra.Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank Group, introduced ‘integrated national financing frameworks’ (INFFs). He also noted that without coordinated, efficient institutions and solid policies, additional financing will not lead a country to its desired results.In comments from participants, Marcos Neto, UN Development Programme (UNDP), called for continuing the work of Tax Inspectors without Borders, and he highlighted the work of the UN’sTask Force on Digital Finance. He stressed the need for tools to define whether a private capital investment is in line with the SDGs, both to demonstrate the market impact of aligning with the SDGs, and to avoid “SDG washing.”Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), expressed concern that foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to fall for the least developed countries (LDCs). She called for re-examining the definition of “bad debt,” suggesting that a debt to advance the SDGs may be “good debt.” She added that a major issue is “who owns the data,” and that the 2020 FSDR will be very important in addressing technology.A representative of Norway urged creativity in “getting the message out” about financing sustainable development, saying the need for higher interest in the topic.Concluding the event, DESA officials noted that the UNGA’shigh-level dialogueon financing for development (FfD) will take place on 26 September 2019 with the expected participation of 80 heads of state and government and ministers to discuss ways to improve FfD.

"A side event that convened during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, considered the ways in which integrated actions on air quality and inclusion in climate plans of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as methane and black carbon benefit near-term climate action, air quality, and health. The event also showcased activities of national and non-governmental actors that tackle both climate and air quality challenges.Presented by the Government of Nigeria, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), German Climate Association (DKK) and the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS), the event titled, ‘Strengthening Climate Promises: Action on Air Quality to Enhance Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),’ took place on 5 December.Yerima Peter Tarfa, Director, Department of Climate Change, Nigeria, said that since joining the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC) in 2014, his country has identified 22 SLCP mitigation measures that would result in multiple benefits, including health improvements, crop loss reductions, water protection, and food security.Shareen Yawanarajah, International Policy Manager, Energy Program, EDF, discussed methane reduction measures for enhancing climate ambition and air quality, noting that this requires engagement with major producers, namely the oil and gas industry, and a paradigm shift in the energy sector towards investments in natural gas.María Amparo Martínez Arroyo, Director General, Instituto Nacional de Ecología y Cambio Climático (INECC), Mexico, highlighted the Supporting National Action and Planning on SLCPs (SNAP) initiative for Mexico, which was developed in 2019 with the aim of achieving a 51% reduction of methane and a 22% reduction of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 2030.Bala Bappa, Federal Ministry of Environment, Nigeria, explained that the priority sectors for action in his country’s SNAP include cookstoves, agriculture, transport, brick kilns, and the oil and gas industry.Speakers also highlighted,inter alia:black carbon as one of the main contributors to cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and lower tract infections;capacity building to raise awareness on including methane and black carbon into the next round of NDCs; andthe need to deploy available clean technologies to tackle air pollution.A success story in South Africa was also spotlighted, where a correlation was made between the location of coal power plants, air quality, and human health.

"One year after its opening for signature, the Declaration for Gender Responsive Standards and Standards Development has 64 signatories. The Declaration was developed by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) as part of an effort to make the standards governing various industries more gender responsive.Signing the Declaration on 14 May 2020, the one-year anniversary of itsopening, Fairtrade International recognized the role of standards in promoting gender equality across global supply chains.Fairtrade International represents 1.7 million small-scale farmers and workers worldwide. It owns theFAIRTRADE Markthat is placed on over 30,000 fair-trade-certified products worldwide. Fairtrade advances better prices and decent working conditions for farmers and workers in developing countries.UNECE notes that clearly designed and monitored gender responsive standards can help close the gender gap in agriculture, by which women have less access to resources such as land, inputs, information, credit and technical assistance.UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova said agriculture is a major global employer, and empowering female farmers is therefore key to achieve “not only SDG 5, but the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” [UNECE press release] [Declaration] [Signatories]",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

"The 2021 edition of the annual World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) report underscores the importance of the SDGs for emerging stronger from the “Great Disruption” to the world economy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.The WESP report, produced by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and released on 25 January 2021, asserts that the only way to offset the socio-economic devastation resulting from the pandemic is to make “smart investments in economic, societal and climate resilience.”Neither resilience nor sustainable development can exist without the other.The 2021 WESP report updates a mid-2020 prediction, to report that 131 million additional people are likely living in poverty as a result of COVID-19. The authors predict that the “cardinal” SDG target – eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 (SDG target 1.1) – will be missed by a large margin. Other SDGs will suffer collateral damage from rising poverty, they warn.The report depicts resilience as going hand-in-hand with sustainable development, noting that one cannot exist without the other. Therefore, governments’ response to the pandemic-induced economic crisis must include building resilience against future economic, social, and climatic shocks. This can be guided by the SDGs, and in turn will reinforce the ability to make progress on each Goal.The report includes in-depth sections on each region of the world. In South Asia, for example, it notes that the pandemic has ravaged countries and reversed their progress on many SDGs, “turning this former growth champion into the worst performing region in 2020.” In South Asian countries, existing vulnerabilities were aggravated by weak public health infrastructure (low expenditure and few care providers per capita), and governments faced difficult choices between health and economic measures. As a result they were not able to take sufficient measures to slow the spread of the virus due to the lack of social safety nets, and their economies’ limited diversification, among other factors. Those hit hardest by the crisis include women, children, slum dwellers, migrant workers and the elderly. South Asia’s experience serves as a prime example of the interactions between securing progress towards SDG targets and protecting economies from future shocks.DESA produced the WESP report in partnership with the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the five UN regional commissions. [Publication:World Economic Situation and Prospects 2021] [DESA press release]",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Adaptation Without Borders, a joint initiative seeking to respond to the challenges of climate change adaptation by strengthening international cooperation and building global resilience, released a policy brief that explores opportunities to advance climate-resilient trade and production among EU member States. The brief offers recommendations within the context of consultations on the EU Adaptation Strategy and the Trade Policy Review.The policy brief titled, ‘Climate-resilient Trade and Production: The Transboundary Effects of Climate Change and Their Implications for EU Member States,’ argues that climate change impacts “are already creating cascading risks that intersect with trade patterns and international supply chains.” Such risks include the disruption of trade or transport, including electricity generation and transmission and diminished production of particular agricultural goods. The brief states that these risks pose a growing challenge for EU member States, and have the potential to reverberate across the global economy.Several EU countries have conducted assessments of transboundary climate risks. Germany’s assessment finds that the economic impacts of trade-related transboundary climate risk are greater than the combined effects of all direct climate change impacts within Germany’s borders. Assessments by Switzerland and the UK find similar results on the effects of transboundary climate change. Although several countries have conducted such assessments, EU member States have not yet developed policy responses based on their findings.To address transboundary climate risks, the brief highlights the importance of EU leadership in guiding risk assessment and developing policy responses to transboundary climate risks. The brief states that decision making should be guided by three principles: effectiveness in reducing and managing risks; clear designation of responsibility; and fairness in the distributional impacts of the policies’ effects, including discussion about who will gain from particular policies and who may be harmed. The brief recommends that the EU support its member States in identifying, managing, and reducing transboundary climate risks by creating common guidance and methodologies, developing innovative governance mechanisms to strengthen resilience, fostering cross-sectoral and international cooperation, and harnessing strategic partnerships. The brief provides specific recommendations for EU member States on conducting assessments of transboundary climate risks in trade and production systems, and identifying, assessing, and implementing policy options.The brief concludes that building more resilient societies, including climate-resilient trade and production systems, is critical in creating a more sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant economy that can withstand the shocks and stresses of a changing climate. Addressing transboundary climate risks will also support the European Green Deal and the EU’s green COVID-19 recovery. The brief highlights the potential of the EU Adaptation Strategy and the Trade Policy Review in building a resilient global European economy.A seminar on ‘Climate-Resilient Trade and Production,’ held on 9 July 2020, involving 45 representatives from 17 EU member States and European and international organizations, helped inform the brief’s findings and recommendations. The Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) organized the seminar on behalf of Adaptation Without Borders, in collaboration with the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, the European Commission, and the Horizon 2020 project CASCADES. [Publication:Climate-resilient Trade and Production: The Transboundary Effects of Climate Change and Their Implications for EU Member States]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"23 September 2019: At the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, high-level officials from government, business and civil society launched the ‘Zero Carbon Buildings for All Initiative,’ which unites leaders across sectors in an international coalition to decarbonize the building sector and meet the Paris Agreement on climate change. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) and private financial institutions also committed to aligning their financing of buildings with the Paris Agreement and national climate policies, which could lead to a potential USD 1 trillion in “Paris compliant” buildings investment in developing countries by 2030.The Zero Carbon Buildings for All Initiative responds to the need of making all buildings net zero carbon by 2050 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, while fewer than 1% of buildings are today.Launched on 23 September 2019 in New York, US, the initiative aims to secure commitments from two audiences: national and local leaders, to develop and implement policies to drive decarbonization of all new buildings by 2030 and all existing buildings by 2050; and financial and industry partners, to provide expert input and commit USD 1 trillion of market action by 2030.A World Resources Institute (WRI) press release notes that while in the past zero carbon buildings were considered a target only for wealthy countries, current policy pathways allow the reach of zero carbon buildings regardless of location or development status. At theClimate Action Summit, commitments to the Zero Carbon Buildings for All initiative included:National governments such as Kenya, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the UK;Financial institutions such as the African Development Bank (AfDB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Investment Fund for Developing Countries (Denmark), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the European Investment Bank (EIB);Private sector actors who offered their technical expertise, including Gensler, BuroHappold, ROCKWOOL Group, and Saint-Gobain; andCivil society partners such as the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Program for Energy Efficiency in Buildings, Urban Land Institute, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Green Building Council (WGBC), and WRI.The initiative aims to complement similar initiatives such as the WGBC’sNet Zero Carbon Buildings Commitmentand the Global Alliance for Building and Construction’s Global Call.

"The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Division for Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Oslo Governance Centre have produced an analytical framework for examining the quality of stakeholder engagement practices related to the SDGs and 2030 Agenda. During a launch event, officials said the tool was developed in the belief that “our societies are stronger when people can contribute to decisions that affect their lives.”The authors of the framework recall that the 2030 Agenda envisions an important role for stakeholders in “holding governments accountable for their actions or lack thereof.” The framework is presented in a publication titled, ‘What is a ‘Good Practice’? A Framework to Analyse the Quality of Stakeholder Engagement in Implementation and Follow-up of the 2030 Agenda,’ which was launched on 26 January 2021.The framework uses three principles of quality stakeholder engagement, with two dimensions specified for each: inclusion (non-discrimination and accessibility); participation (access to information for engagement and influencing decision-making); and accountability (transparency and responsiveness). Each dimension can be assessed on a continuum of four levels of effort.The publication includes key findings from testing the framework in five countries: Benin, Finland, Jordan, Jamaica, and Timor-Leste.

"An event held virtually on the sidelines of the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) addressed risks associated with transitioning away from fossil fuels, and opportunities for diversification and sustainable development in Africa.The event titled, ‘Managing Stranded Assets Risks and Opportunities: Moving Towards Decarbonized Economies and Inclusive Growth in Africa,’ also drew on developed country strategies and ways in which a just recovery can be achieved through international solidarity.The event was organized by the UNU Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (UNU-INRA), UNU Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS), UNU Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA).The session built on the UNU-INRA report onAfrican Development in the Age of Stranded Assets, which discusses Africa’s development in light of potential asset stranding. The report aims to raise awareness on the need for effective natural resource management by African governments to achieve lower-carbon economies.Osabarima Owusu Baafi Aboagye III, Chief of Akyem Dwenase, presented a keynote message on behalf of Okyenhene Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, King of Akyem Abuakwa, Ghana. He said Africa’s policymakers must avoid the risk of stranded hydrocarbon resources and use them to drive the continent’s industrialization agenda.Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, Japan, highlighted partnerships with developing countries to support the SDGs through integrated policy approaches.Fatima Denton, Director, UNU-INRA, said COVID-19 has created major problems for hydrocarbon-dependent economies, with the sharp decrease in global oil prices. She explained Africa faces a paradox of plenty with rich hydrocarbon and mineral resources, while remaining largely energy poor. She highlighted the need to,inter alia:decouple economic growth from carbon intensive investments;scale up solar PV deployment;harness renewable energy potential;investment in digital economies; andunlock climate finance.On ways to manage the risks of stranded assets and opportunities of green transitions in Africa, panelists emphasized, among others, the importance of public sector investment to leverage private investment in clean energy solutions. They also discussed ways to ensure green transitions in urban spaces and support sustainable cities in Africa, emphasizing that decarbonization creates green jobs. Panelists also emphasized the need to include measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in COVID-19 recovery strategies, and break policymaking silos and follow diverse pathways that include renewable energy.The event took place on 10 July 2020 in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"6 September 2019: In response to record-breaking numbers of wildfires, seven Amazon countries signed the Leticia Pact to protect the Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest tropical rainforest. The Pact underscores the importance of implementing and generating synergies between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.In 2019, fires in Brazil, which contains 60% of the Amazon rainforest, increased by 83% as compared to 2018. Wildfires also occurred in Bolivia, on its border with Brazil and Paraguay. In response, leaders from the seven Amazon countries convened in Leticia, in the Colombian Amazon.In the resulting Leticia Pact, Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Suriname recognize the value of the Amazon for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and its role as a source of freshwater and as a climate regulator. The seven countries agree to strengthen coordinated action on forests and biodiversity to combat deforestation and forest degradation; increase initiatives for restoration, rehabilitation and accelerated reforestation; and promote initiatives for connectivity of priority ecosystems. The countries also agree to establish mechanisms for regional cooperation and information exchange to combat illegal activities that threaten the conservation of the Amazon and to exchange experiences in integrated fire management. Amazon countries also agree to increase the participation of indigenous communities, including the empowerment of indigenous women.Further, the countries state their intention to create an Amazon network for natural disaster cooperation among emergency operations centers to coordinate on national disaster prevention, including large-scale forest fires. They will increase their national and regional efforts to address forest degradation and deforestation and coordinate their responses to disasters, such as the 2019 wildfires. The countries will also cooperate to increase satellite monitoring of deforestation, share information on forest threats, such as illegal mining, and promote an early warning system for deforestation and degradation.The countries agree to coordinate on formulating an action plan to implement their commitments under the Pact and to hold follow-up meetings to evaluate progress.

"A UN expert group concluded its assessment of efforts to eradicate marine plastic litter and microplastics. The outcome will be sent to the upcoming fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).The fourth meeting of the ad-hoc open-ended expert group on marine litter and microplastics (AHEG-4) convened virtually from 9-13 November 2020. It was the final meeting of the AHEG, with the experts having completed their mandate from UNEA.As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, at the opening of the meeting, officials drew attention to the impacts of COVID-19 on single-use plastics, noting in particular the burden on waste management posed by disposable masks and other personal protective equipment that contains plastic.Almost unanimously, delegates agreed that “upstream” activities will be needed to prevent pollution.Delegates discussed a stocktaking conducted by the Secretariat of current actions on marine litter and microplastics, and considered the effectiveness of current responses to the problem. The Secretariat found a predominance of “downstream” efforts that are performed at the national and sub-national level, and focused overwhelmingly on awareness-raising activities and beach-clean-ups. Almost unanimously, delegates agreed that “upstream activities” related to pollution prevention are going to be key to addressing this challenge.The Group agreed to a Chair’s summary, which was hailed as a neutral and factual document and contained a “non-exhaustive list of response options to marine litter and microplastics.” They annexed the summary to the report of the meeting, which will be presented to delegates at UNEA-5. Delegates supported the summary as a balance of views shared during the entire AHEG process, acknowledging that the document was not a negotiated outcome. However, several reiterated their hope that the summary would include stronger language on the need to establish a negotiating process towards a new global agreement on plastic pollution.UNEA-5 is expected to consider these options, including whether to endorse a global agreement, when it convenes virtually in February 2021. In the closing words of the ENB analysis, “COVID-19 has rattled many long-held truths, but even it cannot rattle the interminable nature of plastics and all that comes with it.” [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of AHEG-4]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
"The Baha’i International Community in collaboration with the Together First and UN2020 campaigns are holding a series of dialogues to generate ideas for the UN’s 75th anniversary declaration. The dialogues gather UN Member States, civil society, and UN representatives for off-the-record discussions, in parallel to the ongoing intergovernmental consultations on the declaration.The co-facilitators for negotiations on the declaration – Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden –issuedan “elements paper” on 9 April. The paper proposes the declaration contain three sections: Acknowledging achievements and looking ahead; Delivering on commitments and responding to global challenges; and Building consensus and mobilizing for change.In 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature.The first dialogue in the series took place on 23 April with a focus on ‘Acknowledging Achievements and looking ahead,’ the first section of the elements paper. According to thediscussion summary, this dialogue gathered 157 representatives from 19 UN Member States and over 100 civil society organizations. The discussion highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic represents the clearest example of several, intersecting global crises. It points to the need to strengthen multilateralism and address mistrust.Participants noted that in 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature. It was emphasized that inclusion is “not solely for representation,” since one group’s advancement should lead to the advancement of all. Similarly, national sovereignty itself should be re-evaluated. No country is autonomous in this interdependent world, participants emphasized, and addressing problems globally is in the best interest of all.Building on this idea, the declaration should propose that the UN no longer function to find equilibrium among competing national interests, but strive to replace an intergovernmental approach with a supranational one. Other proposals included:Establish a post-2020 process to consider and implement recommendations for reform.Re-evaluate process for reaching consensus, to ensure a “recalcitrant few” cannot hold back a vast majority.Consider possible formats for a UN Parliamentary Assembly.The second dialogue, on 30 April, took up the declaration’s possible section on ‘Delivering on Commitments and Responding to Global Challenges,’ which isexpectedto contain the most substantive, practical proposals, and serve as the primary vehicle to lay out a plan for the future of the UN. The third dialogue in the series will convene on 7 May, to address ‘Building consensus and mobilizing for change.’ This section is meant to serve as the call to service for the governments of the world.The co-facilitators of the intergovernmental consultations plan to share a zero draft of the declaration in early May 2020. The consultations are taking place via written comments. A virtual informal consultation will be convened to discuss the zero draft later in May 2020.

"24 September 2019: Germany and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) have launched the Global Opportunities for SDGs (GO for SDGs) initiative to accelerate the building of inclusive and sustainable economies. GO for SDGs will serve as platform to facilitate regional dialogue and exchange among practitioners on best practices for replicating and scaling-up effects, and foster local institutional learning and experience sharing.At the launch event on the sidelines of the SDG Summit, in New York, US, Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety of Germany, said the initiative will focus on scaling up the use of existing initiatives and adapting them to specific national circumstances, stressing the need to translate the SDGs at regional and local levels to ensure the Goals provide answers to local needs. She announced Germany’s contribution of EUR 7.5 million to the initiative, called on governments to embark on the journey to become carbon neutral by 2050, like Germany, and invited other partners to join the GO for SDGs initiative.Citing several recent reports on SDG implementation, Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director, stressed that many current challenges receive insufficient attention, including rapidly increasing resource consumption and biodiversity decline. She underlined that SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) has the potential to unlock progress on several SDGs. She said UNEP’s One Planet network is an example of the existing platforms that GO for SDGs will utilize to enable knowledge-sharing and cross-country learning.Krista Mikkonen, Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Finland, said her country wants to lead by example by making Finland climate-neutral by 2035 and moving towards a circular economy. Mikkonen added that, under the One Planet Network, Finland has taken responsibility for the programme for sustainable building and construction. Mikkonen explained that GO for SDGs is necessary to create a pool of practical local answers and solutions to SDG implementation.Lucía Ruíz, Minister of Environment, Peru, highlighted the need for a grassroots, multi-stakeholder approach to SDG implementation. She called for “multi-alignment” of government policies and actions. Ruiz also underscored the need to tackle corruption in local administrations.

"The Global Risks Report 2020 has been published in advance of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). According to a press release by the WEF, “for the first time in the survey’s 10-year outlook, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood are all environmental.”The Global Risks Report informs the WEF’s multi-stakeholder initiatives throughout the year.The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.The report frames the global economy asfacingincreased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.TheWorld Economic Forumwill convene from 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland under the theme, ‘A Cohesive and Sustainable World.’ The meeting aims to “shape global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.” The Four global issues that will feature prominently on the agenda include environmental challenges, sustainable business; technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and demographic, social and technological trends reshaping education, employment and entrepreneurship.

"The yearly report of the UN Secretary-General on progress towards the 17 SDGs has been released ahead of the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July. [Publication:Report of the Secretary-General: Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals] [Global SDG Indicators Database][SDG Knowledge Hub story about 2019 SDG Progress Report]",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"In an article published inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scholars from the Millennium Institute argue that enhanced understanding of synergies in sustainable development planning can support accelerated progress on the SDGs and produce significant cost savings. Pilot studies in three countries – Côte d’Ivoire, Malawi and Senegal – were used to test this typology.The article titled, ‘Harvesting synergy from sustainable development goal interactions,’ calls for a deeper understanding of the cross-sectoral impacts and synergies among policies to meet the SDGs. The authors present a system dynamics-based model that they call “an integrated SDG (iSDG) model” for national-scale planning. The iSDG model enables simulation of “what-if” scenarios, assessing multiple policies in aggregate or individually to anticipate the effects of SDG policies across sectors.In the pilots, the authors used the iSDG model to test the performance of 80 targets under both a business-as-usual scenario reflecting current budget allocations and policies, and an SDG policy scenario of “ambitious interventions” to achieve the SDGs. Under the business-as-usual scenario, countries would have “very low levels of achievement by 2030.” Côte d’Ivoire, for instance, achieved a simulated level of achievement of 21% by 2030.The authors found synergy contributions to overall SDG performance were highest in Côte d’Ivoire, at 7%, with synergy observed for nine of the 17 SDGs; followed by 2% for Senegal, which exhibited synergy for six of the SDGs; and 0.7% for Malawi, which showed synergy for three of the SDGs. The authors estimate these contributions represent a gross domestic product (GDP) benefit of 3% for Côte d’Ivoire, 0.7% for Senegal and 0.4% for Malawi. They conclude that effectively harvesting such synergies could free up resources for further SDG investment.The authors also observed SDG “dissynergy” in the three countries, suggesting a “simulated drag on performance” of 10% for Côte d’Ivoire’s overall SDG performance. Dissynergy resulted in an 8% drag in performance in the Malawi model, and 4% in the Senegal model. The authors note that some dissynergies suggest areas where resources could be “more productively allocated to other sector policies.”The authors highlight the applicability of these findings beyond their three pilot countries.

"The 52nd session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-52) concluded with agreement on the outline for the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report.The outline, which was discussed throughout the week-long meeting and was the subject of contact group discussions on the penultimate evening and last day of IPCC-52, contains a stage-setting introduction and three sections: Current Status and Trends; Long-term Climate and Development Futures; and Near-term Responses in a Changing Climate. TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinreportfrom the meeting indicates that “some of the more contentious issues that came up during the discussions on the outline related to the carbon budget, timeframes, just transition, and extreme events and loss and damage, among others.”In addition, delegates at the meeting, which took place from 24-28 February 2020, in Paris, France, discussed the organization of future work of the IPCC in light of the Global Stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement, on which views diverged over a range of options regarding possible alignment of IPCC and GST cycles. Some questioned the need for discussing an alignment at this point, while others suggested other ways of promoting timely inputs to the GST.The Panel also adopted the IPCC Gender Policy and Implementation Plan, which establishes a Gender Action Team to oversee and monitor implementation of the Plan and develop and implement a protocol and process for addressing complaints. The Panel considered reviewing the Principles Governing IPCC Work, and whether to establish a task team to consider which elements might need reviewing, but participants did not agree on a review process, and the Panel will consider recommendations forwarded by the Bureau at IPCC-53.In closing remarks, IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee thanked delegates for their work and efforts, which “paid respect to the spirit of cooperation and upheld the integrity of the IPCC and objectivity of its assessment activities.” [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of IPCC-52]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"The United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) World Council 2020 met to address the role of the international municipal and regional movement “in COVID times.” Many speakers emphasized that cities must be central to leading a strong, sustainable recovery from the pandemic and the fight against climate change.The meeting convened virtually on 11-13 November 2020.The President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) told participants that it is through local governments and cities that the UN can translate its global vision into reality and implement frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the New Urban Agenda. Providing another perspective, some participants said local governments are no longer just implementers of policy, but must also play a key role in formulating policy for a strong and green recovery.Among other key messages, participants said:COVID-19 has exacerbated existing inequalities, and “radical change” will be needed to overcome them;COVID-19 provides an opportunity to foster inclusive, just, resilient and sustainable cities; andCollaboration and partnership among stakeholders are needed for a sustainable recovery.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said solutions to our current crises should be holistic, and “the local space is the perfect place to connect the dots.” He said regional and local governments can hold national governments accountable for their climate and sustainable development commitments “including by pushing for action to achieve carbon neutrality — net‑zero emissions — by 2050.” He added that recovery packages and other public spending should boost local government capacity.As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, outcomes from the 2020 World Council relate to:Establishing a UCLG International Solidarity Fund to strengthen local governance;Appointing three new Ubuntu Advisors to contribute to expanding outreach and advocacy for UCLG, particularly with the UN and other stakeholders;Greenlighting work to define strategic priorities for the next decalogue; andEstablishing a new policy council on Implementation of the New Urban Agenda.[Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of UCLG World Council 2020] [Remarks of UNGA President] [Remarks of UN Secretary-General]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

"The Secretaries-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have issued a joint statement in support of keeping ships moving, ports open, and cross-border trade flowing during the COVID-19 pandemic.In the statement, dated 8 June 2020, IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim and UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi outline the impact of COVID-19 on those who operate the world’s merchant ships. The statement highlights the importance of maritime transport, which carries more than 80% of global trade by volume and is dependent on over 2 million seafarers. However, the statement estimates that starting in mid-June 2020, approximately 300,000 seafarers per month will need to take international repatriation flights (whether by air or sea) in order to enable changeover of the ships’ crews. Such changeover is necessary, the statement emphasizes, to reduce fatigue, ensure safe operations and crew well-being, and to comply with international safety and employment regulations.Accordingly, IMO and UNCTAD encourage governments and relevant authorities to designate seafarers, including marine personnel, fishing vessel personnel, offshore energy sector personnel, and service providers at ports “key workers” that provide essential services and therefore are exempted from travel restrictions.Similarly, the statement calls for efforts to “identify and remove any unnecessary regulatory obstacles to post-pandemic recovery.” Approaches include exemptions, waivers, electronic solutions and sharing of pre-arrival information. Highlighting the potential benefits of these measures in a post-pandemic world, the statement notes that the actions can encourage further investment in digitalization, energy efficiency efforts, and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions from shipping.The Secretaries-General close by underscoring the need to keep ships moving, ports open, and cross-border trade flowing, and to avoid logistics obstacles that could potentially lead to supply shortages.

"10 July 2019: The UN and Angry Birds are collaborating to support citizen action on climate change. The Angry Birds are encouraging individuals to discover and record everyday actions that can make a difference on climate change by using the UN’s online climate action tool, the ‘ActNow Bot.’The UN Department of Global Communications (DGC) is collaborating with the UN Foundation and Sony Pictures Entertainment in support of the UN’s ActNow climate campaign, which aims to galvanize individual action on climate change. The campaign is part of the UN’s efforts to raise awareness, ambition and action for climate change and to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The campaign features the animated bird and pig characters and voice actors from The Angry Birds Movie 2.The ActNow Bot is an interactive chatbox on the UN’s ActNow website that connects with users and emphasizes the power of individuals to tackle climate change. The interactive tool suggests ten actions that individuals can take in their daily life to protect the environment and tackle climate change. These actions include saving energy, eating less meat, eating local produce, using reuseable bags and water bottles, “upcycling” clothing, taking five-minute showers, driving less, recycling, turning lights off, and unplugging electronics. Individuals can then record their collective actions to tackle climate change on the website. To date, people have recorded 154,639 climate actions. These actions will be presented at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019.The UN launched the campaign on the sidelines of the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

"UN2020 and Together First virtually convened the UN75 People’s Forum for the UN We Need. The multimedia gathering was held from 14-15 May 2020, and included over 600 attendees from 75 countries around the world.According to the organizers, the event and declaration send a message to the UN and Member States that “a stronger multilateral system is needed as a matter of urgency.” They also underline that the UN’s high-level event to commemorate its 75th anniversary on 21 September should be “the catalyst for the transformative changes urgently needed to successfully address 21st century global challenges.”The outcome document of the People’s Forum, titled ‘Humanity at a Crossroads: Global Solutions for Global Challenges,’ describes the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as akin to the UN rising from the ashes of World War II: it too has the potential to transform global governance to reflect a new reality.The People’s Declaration calls for a process to craft a coherent strategy to fill global governance gaps. In a section on ‘Creating an Enabling Environment,’ the Declaration sets out ten preconditions to enable “the whole of society to contribute to sustainable development and build resilient communities.” The preconditions are: good governance; peaceful and inclusive societies; dignity and human rights; equal opportunity; trust; education; sustainability; prosperity; financing; and implementation of international agreements.The outcome document also contains a plan for global action with three priority recommendations for the UN and Member States:Establish a Member-State-mandated post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance, ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions;Reliably and increasingly fund the UN including by addressing the challenge of unfulfilled Member States’ annual dues and financial commitments, streamlining “archaic” UN budgetary processes, and considering global taxation on fossil fuel, carbon or other commodities; andEnhance participation modalities for civil society and other stakeholders with: a dedicated civil society focal point in the UN Secretariat at the level of Under-Secretary-General; a system-wide review of stakeholder participation in UN processes and adoption of a few well-designed reform proposals; increased use of communications technology to mitigate the digital divide; and a global petition mechanism to surface issues of concern for a critical mass of individuals.The document also contains an annex of additional proposals generated through thecivil society consultationsleading up to the People’s Forum.The Declaration and Plan for Global Action were formally received by UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande during a handover ceremony on 14 May. The President hastransmittedthe outcome document to the co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the declaration to be adopted at the UN’s high-level commemoration event in September 2020.In related news, the co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the UN75 declarationcirculateda zero draft of the political declaration on 14 May.

"4 September 2019: A report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for health services to integrate a stronger focus on ensuring optimum nutrition at each stage of a person’s life, explaining that appropriate investment in nutrition could save 3.7 million lives by 2025. The publication stresses the role of primary health care as the foundation of universal health coverage (UHC).The report titled, ‘Essential Nutrition Actions: Mainstreaming Nutrition Throughout the Life-course,’ argues that primary health care is the foundation of UHC, being a whole-of-society approach to health and well-being centered on the needs and preferences of individuals, families and communities. According to WHO, nutrition is a foundation for health and well-being for all, leaving no one behind, and a key element of primary health care, and plays an essential role in prevention.Investment in nutrition will also help countries achieve the SDGs, WHO explains in a press release, while bringing substantial economic benefits: every USD 1 spent by donors on basic nutrition programmes will return USD 16 to the local economy.The report cautions that while there has been progress in reducing stunting from 1990 to 2018 (the prevalence of stunting in children aged under 5 years declined from 39.2% to 21.9%), obesity is on the rise, both in the case of adults and children, with obesity in children having increased from 4.8% to 5.9%. Noting that 13% of the world’s population is obese, WHO emphasizes that obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers.The report contains a compilation of nutrition actions aimed at addressing malnutrition in all its forms, “in a concise and user-friendly format,” to help decision makers integrate nutrition interventions in national health policies, strategies, and plans based on country-specific needs and global priorities. The Organization highlights that essential health packages in all settings need to contain “robust” nutrition components.Key nutrition interventions recommended by WHO include:providing iron and folic acid supplements as part of antenatal care;delaying umbilical cord clamping to ensure babies receive important nutrients they need after birth;promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding;providing advice on diet such as limiting the intake of free sugars in adults and children; andlimiting salt intake to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.[Publication:Essential Nutrition Actions: Mainstreaming Nutrition Throughout the Life-course] [Publication Landing Page] [WHO Press Release]",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"September 2019: The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has released a publication on the linkages and complementarities between forest landscape restoration (FLR) and land degradation neutrality (LDN). The report recommends priority actions for optimizing synergies among FLR and LDN objectives.The publication titled, ‘Reviving land and restoring landscapes,’ highlights the policy convergence between processes to set targets and achieve FLR and LDN. The Bonn Challenge aims to restore 150 million hectares by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. SDG target 15.3 calls for combating desertification and achieving a LDN world by 2030. Commitments for landscape restoration under the Bonn Challenge contribute to country LDN goals; similarly, country commitments to LDN can support FLR.The report underscores how interventions to support FLR and LDN can contribute to biodiversity conservation, the goals of the post-2020 biodiversity agenda and climate mitigation and adaptation. Further, implementing sustainable land management (SLM) can improve water efficiency and quality, contributing to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and also contributing to agricultural productivity and food security (SDG 2) as well as SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), among other SDGs.Commitments for landscape restoration under the Bonn Challenge contribute to country LDN goals; similarly, country commitments to LDN can support FLR.The report emphasizes that countries are “making significant progress in target setting.” To date, 59 countries and private organizations have pledged to restore over 168 million hectares through the Bonn Challenge. By May 2019, 122 countries had committed to set national targets for LDN. To improve efficiencies in land and landscape restoration, the report recommends that governments and development partners strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration and reporting. To sustain momentum for delivering both aims, the report further recommends that governments and development partners promote consultation among the leads of the Bonn Challenge, the LDN and national focal points and create an enabling environment for private investment.The publication identifies an opportunity for Parties to the Rio Conventions to optimize synergies and impacts across these two initiatives to align investments and actions with national restoration agendas, strengthen inter-sectoral coordination, and promote consolidated reporting. The report describes how countries that capture synergies between Bonn Challenge and LDN commitments have effective inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms; in 7 of 13 countries analyzed, countries oversee Bonn Challenge and LDN commitments within the same government entity. For example, the report finds Côte d’Ivoire “demonstrates a balanced landscape restoration approach” in both FLR and LDN. Cameroon has aligned its FLR and LDN targets and references the Bonn Challenge in its LDN report.The Rio Conventions are the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

"The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has launched a Consolidated Global Humanitarian Appeal to support approximately 40 vulnerable countries in fighting COVID-19. OCHA notes that the virus is spreading to countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis related to conflict, climate change, or natural disasters. If it is not stopped, it will continue spreading around the world even as other countries begin to recover.The USD 2 billion appeal, launched on 25 March 2020, will support a Global Humanitarian Response Plan to be implemented by UN agencies working with international NGOs and NGO consortia around the world. OCHA said theApril-December 2020 planaims to: deliver testing equipment and treatment supplies; install handwashing stations in camps and settlements; and establish “airbridges” and other means to move humanitarian workers and supplies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, announced the release of USD 60 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to catalyze contributions to the Fund. CERF had previously released USD 15 million for humanitarian efforts in response to COVID-19. In addition, country-based pooled funds have allocated over USD 3 million to date.Speaking during the virtual launch of the appeal, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterressaid, “We must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable – millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves.” He stressed that working in solidarity is “crucial for combating the virus.”In supporting the Fund, governments are cautioned against diverting funding from existing humanitarian operations, which could “create an environment in which cholera, measles and meningitis can thrive, in which even more children become malnourished, and in which extremists can take control – an environment that would be the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus,” per theOCHA press release.Separately, on 13 March, the World Health Organization (WHO)launchedthe COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, appealing to a wide range of donors for USD 675 million to support its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan on the global health response to the pandemic.The Fund allows private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world to directly contributeCOVID19ResponseFund.org. Facebook and Google have instituted a matching scheme for funds raised through their platforms.The WHO’s COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan aims to enable all countries to prepare for and respond to COVID-19. Funding is sought to:Provide protective equipment for frontline health workers;Equip diagnostic laboratories;Improve surveillance and data collection;Establish and maintain intensive care units;Strengthen supply chains; andAccelerate research and development of vaccines and therapeutics.The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund is hosted by two foundations, the UN Foundation (registered in the US) and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation (registered in Switzerland).On 26 March, WHO updated its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19,first issuedin early February. According to theupdated plan, support will be prioritized to countries with weak health systems and significant gaps in preparedness capacity for technical and operational implementation. The WHO has categorized countries into five levels based on operational readiness, as well as the current status of their response scenario (preparedness, high-risk of imported cases, imported cases, localized transmission, and community transmission).",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"To help decision makers facing difficult choices during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has been producing expert policy briefs. The briefs focus on economic and social impacts of the pandemic crisis, and the countries and groups of people most affected.The first set of briefs, released on 1 April, highlights global macroeconomic issues and monetary policy recommendations, including on fiscal stimulus plans to protect jobs, incomes and people in need, and turmoil in financial markets.The second set released in April addresses: how commodity-exporting countries can avert a double health and economic crisis; digital government and data privacy in public service; and the need for better use of science and technology.The latest set was released on 1 May and focuses on the pandemic’s impact on countries in special situations, covering: threats to sustainable development progress in the least developed countries (LDCs); how COVID-19 responses could “turn the tide on inequality”; the dire impacts of the pandemic on small island developing States (SIDS); and the importance of “balanced recovery” in Europe.UN Under-Secretary-General Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, wrote in aguest articleon the SDG Knowledge Hub that leaders’ decisions during the pandemic not only affect people’s lives and livelihoods today, but are also shaping the world that will emerge from the COVID-19 lockdown.

"The Advancing Learning and Innovation on Gender Norms (ALIGN) platform released a guide on gender norms and women in politics, in the lead-up to the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform of Action.The guide titled, ‘Gender norms and women in politics: Evaluating progress and identifying challenges on the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Platform,’ published in August 2020, is authored by Rachel George with Emma Samman, Katie Washington, and Alina Ojha.The 1995Beijing Declarationincludes a goal to ensure women’s equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision-making. The ALIGN publication finds that women are increasingly exercising their right to political participation, but many still “find their way barred by the gender norms that see politics as a masculine space.” The guide highlights how, 25 years after adoption of the Beijing Declaration, gender norms still influence women’s parliamentary representation, women’s experiences running for and standing in leadership positions, and women’s engagement in civic action and social movements.The authors determine that “across many cultures and societies, it is increasingly common for young generations of girls to aspire to political leadership.” This is due to rising access to and achievement in education and economic shifts, as well as women’s movements and women leaders of wider social movements, among other factors. At the same time, the authors report, coalitions and movements that don’t support gender equality also are growing in power and influence.The guide also presents statistics showing trends in women’s political participation. Women’s parliamentary representation has doubled since 1995, from 12% to 25% worldwide. The number of countries with more than 30% female representation has risen from 5 to 51. At the level of heads of state and government, the authors report that women account for just 10% of leaders worldwide – but in 1966, no country had ever had an elected female leader. Sub-nationally, fewer than 5% of the world’s mayors are women, and women account for just 20% of local councilors worldwide on average, although data on these trends are limited.ALIGN is a digital platform and programme of work aiming to create a global community of researchers and thought leaders committed to gender justice and equality. The initiative provides research, insights, and grants to examine and change discriminatory gender norms. ALIGN is currently led by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Government of Canada.On 1 October 2020, the UN General Assembly will convene a high-level meeting to commemorate Beijing+25. The high-level meeting on 1 October will focus on ‘Accelerating the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.’ Theconcept noteindicates the plenary segment will focus on concrete actions to achieve this goal. [Publication:Gender norms and women in politics: Evaluating progress and identifying challenges on the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Platform] [ODI press release]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"A group of WTO members established an Informal Working Group on Trade and Gender to increase the participation of women in trade. An online meeting, held at the invitation of Iceland and Botswana, launched the working group on 23 September 2020.The working group’s establishment marks the next phase of a 2017 initiative toremove barriersto women’s participation in trade. The initiative emanated from theBuenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women’s Economic Empowerment, which was supported by 118 WTO members and observers at the 11th Ministerial Conference and now has 127 signatories.Introducing the proposal to establish the Informal Working Group, Iceland Ambassador Harald Aspelund, Co-chair of the International Gender Champions (IGC) Trade Impact Group, said it “stemmed from consultations with WTO members who expressed support for following-up on the commitments contained in the Buenos Aires Declaration.”Women’s empowerment is at the heart of building economies that are more economically prosperous and socially inclusive.The working group will focus on: continuing to share best practices among WTO members on increasing the participation of women in trade; clarifying the meaning of a “gender lens” in the context of international trade and reviewing how it could be applied to the work of the WTO; reviewing and discussing the WTO Secretariat’s gender-related analytical products; and exploring ways to support the delivery of the WTO Aid for Trade work programme.Addressing meeting participants, WTO Deputy Director-General Yonov Frederick Agah (Nigeria) described women’s empowerment as being “at the heart of building economies that are more economically prosperous and socially inclusive.” He outlined the WTO’s ongoing efforts stemming from the Buenos Aires Declaration, and noted that the working group’s launch “marks an important new phase in moving this work forward on a continued transparent, collaborative and open basis.” Agah recognized the disproportionate impacts of trade-related disruptions from COVID-19 on women due to women’s overrepresentation in services and sectors that have seen the sharpest falls in demand, concluding that “we cannot build back better without women.”Botswana Ambassador Athaliah Molokomme, Co-chair of the IGC Trade Impact Group, acknowledged “strong support for the formation of an Informal Working Group,” and identified the need for “concrete activities and timelines.”The working group will convene its first meeting in the second half of 2020 to establish a schedule of activities and themes for discussion ahead of the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), which is currently expected to take place in June 2021.

"The Quick Start Programme reported on its impacts after 13 years of working on the sound management of chemicals in developing countries. The QSP – a funding mechanism under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) – concluded its operations in December 2019.In 2006, the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) established the QSP to help countries produce and use chemicals in ways that minimize adverse impacts on the environment and human health through projects in a range of sectors, including agriculture, environment, health, industry and labor. The Programme reports that its project helped raise awareness and build institutional capacity for the sound management of chemicals at the national level, as well as advance mainstreaming and multi-sectoral approaches.During its tenure, the Programme enabled the implementation of 184 projects in 108 countries, including 54 least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). It mobilized a total of USD 47.9 million through its Trust Fund.QSP projects addressed: chemicals accident preparedness and poison centers; implementation of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions and the Minamata Convention on Mercury; collection and systems for sharing, including pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS); pesticides and agriculture; national chemicals profiles; and mainstreaming development plans and processes.Among its country-specific initiatives, in Sri Lanka the QSP helped national experts, academics and 600 employees from the rubber, textile and tourism industries manage chemicals through training manuals, sector guidelines and an online course. The project titled ‘Empowering Sri Lanka’s vital industries to manage chemicals the SMART way‘ strengthened the capacity of institutions and universities and enhanced efficiency and environmental performance of local industries.In Lesotho, the QSP helpedimprove food security through the proper use of herbicides and pesticides, including through training sessions on safe use for more than 200 farmers, district staff, traders, environment officers and machinery operators, among others.Other projects addressed:Protecting human health and the environment from mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Cambodia and the Philippines;Strengthening national capacities for the sound management of priority carcinogenic chemicals in Bhutan;Building capacities and raising awareness on integrated non-chemical control of mosquitoes in Albania;Capacity building for strengthening the management of heavy metals in Barbados;Strengthening capacities in Burkina Faso for national SAICM implementation and the promotion of synergies among the BRS Conventions; andDeveloping an integrated national programme for the sound management of chemicals and supporting capacity building on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) in Benin.SAICM is a global multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder, voluntary policy framework aimed at minimizing significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020. A new overarching approach for SAICM and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020 is currently under negotiation through an intersessional process that is expected to conclude at ICCM5. [QSP Overview] [QSP at a Glance] [QSP Factsheet on 13 Years] [Interactive Visualization of Projects]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
"A policy brief from the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) emphasizes that reversing the alarming rate of biodiversity loss requires a significant policy shift away from business as usual. The coming decade is of utmost importance for global governance of biodiversity, the authors stress.The brief titled, ‘Biological Diversity: Protecting the variety of life on Earth,’ authored by Elsa Tsioumani and Asterios Tsioumanis, highlights recent findings that “nature is vanishing before our eyes,” and up to one million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. The brief notes the need for “transition pathways,” and reviews the negotiations to establish and further the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its protocols as the main forum for the international community to conserve biodiversity, use its components sustainable, and share fairly and equitably the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.The brief notes that the coming decade is of utmost importance for global biodiversity governance, and a failure to adopt and implement a post-2020 global biodiversity framework “may lead to irreversible biodiversity loss in the near future.”The brief is the second in the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series from the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team, which builds on the message of thelandmark 1972 UN report,‘Only One Earth,’ reminding humanity we have no other home but this planet. The series is being released in the lead-up to the 50th anniversaries of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and the UN Environment Program (UNEP), which will be marked in 2022.The policy briefs assess the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy, drawing on the environmental negotiation insights of the globalENB team. The briefs aim to guide future efforts to address the causes of climate change, support the sustainable management of natural resources, and foster fair and sustainable economies.Thefirst briefin the series, titled ‘Stockholm and the Birth of Environmental Diplomacy,’ by Pamela Chasek, considers the lessons held in the 1972 Conference as it launched a new era of global cooperation on environmental issues and paved the way for the concept of sustainable development and the birth of UNEP.

The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP)  ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the largerGlobal Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.On itsSDG page, the Observatory provides country data forSDG targets and indicatorsrelated to,inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);SDG target 6.a (water and sanitation-related capacity building);SDG target 11.6 (clean cities), including concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM25); andSDG target 16.1 (violence), including homicide rates per 100,000, broken down by sex.TheWorld Health Statistics 2020published on the Observatory’s website the summarizes recent trends in life expectancy and reports on progress towards the main health and health-related SDGs and associated targets.

"July 2019: Germany’s statistical authority has launched a national reporting platform providing data and metadata on its progress towards the 17 SDGs. The platform uses the global indicators approved by the UN General Assembly.TheGerman National Reporting Platform on the SDG Indicators(SDG-NRP) was released on 9 July 2019, during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The platform makes it possible to directly download the national data for individual SDG indicators, which is useful in particular for the custodian agencies of each global indicator.The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)describesthe platform as an interactive environment, and an “open source solution” that makes the corresponding project codepublicly available. TheGuidancepage notes that Germany’s SDG-NRP has been developed in accordance with the UN’s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, which require such a platform to feature open source technology and be publicly accessible. According to the ‘About’ page, the platform uses data from official statistics and from other sources.The ‘Reporting Status’ feature of the platform shows whether each indicator is reported online, has statistics “in progress,” is “not applicable,” or its data sources are still being explored. Overall, the platform reports that 62% of 244 global indicators are reported online. The SDGs with the highest rate of online reporting in Germany are: Goal 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Goal 8 (decent jobs and economic growth) and Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation).Data sources are still being explored for 33% of the global indicators, particularly under Goals 1 (no poverty), 10 (reduced inequalities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action).Among the indicators considered not applicable are those addressing conflict-related deaths, developing countries’ voting rights in international organizations, and population living below the international poverty line.Destatis notes that the US and UK are “precursors” in establishing national reporting platforms for SDG indicators, and a “new universal version” of open SDG platforms is available.

"The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance) has published Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to support the process of developing laws to address lead in paint. Feedback on the document is being accepted through 3 July 2020.The document highlights that lead paint is a major source of childhood lead exposure, but more than 100 countries still lack binding legal limits on lead in paint. TheFAQson lead paint are targeted at government representatives, industry, and civil society organizations.The publication provides information about theModel Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint, which helps countries enact new or modify existing laws to establish a single regulatory limit on the total lead content in paints. It also suggestssteps for establishing a lead paint law, based on the experiences of countries that have adopted such laws.The FAQs detail recommended compliance tools in the Model Law, including:requiring manufacturers and importers to have paint tested for lead content by third-party accredited laboratories using internationally recognized test methods;requiring manufacturers and importers to provide a declaration of conformity, which demonstrates compliance with a lead paint regulation;identifying the government agency with enforcement authority, and detailing enforcement responsibilities; andprohibiting paint that exceeds the legal limit, failure to cooperate with government inspections, failure to provide declarations of conformity or providing false declarations, and attempts to influence a third-party laboratory’s test results.If countries lack a laboratory to conduct accredited, third-party testing, manufacturers and importers can send paint samples to other countries for testing.The Model Law does not address disposal, but it underscores the importance of ensuring that legal frameworks provide for management and disposal in an environmentally sound manner.The FAQs also address: the health, environmental, and economic impacts of lead exposure; the reasoning behind setting a lead limit of 90 ppm in paint; non-lead alternatives; paint reformulation costs; timing of lead paint phase-out, including allowing reasonable time for manufacturers to change paint formulations and production processes; paint testing requirements and methods; and disposal.The Lead Paint Alliance is a voluntary initiative to prevent children’s exposure and minimize occupational exposure to lead paint and to phase out the manufacture, import, and sale of paints containing lead. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) act as Co-Secretariats, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chairs the Alliance’s Advisory Council.

"30 August 2019: Samoa is undertaking an innovative programme to manage hazardous waste, specifically waste oil, with the aim of promoting regional collaboration for long-term solutions to waste management.The Samoa Waste Oil Management Programme (SWOMP) will bring together importers, sellers and users of engine oils and other hazardous fluids to share the costs of managing oil and fluid waste. Through this initiative, Samoa will export collected waste oil for use as an alternate energy source to provide fuel for the Blue Scope Steel Factory in Fiji, which will smelt the waste scrap steel, thereby reducing demand for new fuel resources. A fee will be applied to every liter of waste oil collected, to ensure the programme’s sustainability and continued export of waste from the region.During the launch, Pacific island countries and territories were encouraged to implement more regional collaboration by using the oil management programme, which is being viewed as a regional waste management model.Funding for intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) and other equipment is provided by the Secretariat of the Pacific Environment Programme (SPREP) through the Pacific Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) Reduction Project, which is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and implemented by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).SWOMP was launched on 30 August in Apia, Samoa, during the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to theNoumea Convention(Convention for the Protection of Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region) and the tenth meeting of the COP to theWaigani Convention(Convention to Ban the Importation into Forum Island Countries of Hazardous and Radioactive Wastes and to Control the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes within the South Pacific Region).

The articles are published on the blog of the UN Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government, which is part of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).An article by Louis Meuleman, Rapporteur of the UN Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), discusses the importance of reforming public institutions in order to achieve sustainable development. Reflecting on arecent workshopon governance for sustainable development organized by DESA and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), Meuleman writes that participating governments, UN agencies, civil society, academia and others expressed that they are clear on the needed policies and models to leave no one behind. However, they need more answers regarding the “how” of reforming public administration and governance. Meuleman’s recommendations include:Recognize that effective governance requires adaptation to its specific context, and develop “steering, incentivizing and collaboration mechanisms”;Ensure that rapid reforms do not take place “at the expense of strategic foresight, back-casting or impact analysis”;Establish training for public officials in “sustainability transformation acceleration”; andImplement thePrinciples of Effective Governance for Sustainable Development, which were formulated by CEPA and endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 2018.An article by Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, CEPA Chairperson, further elaborates on discussions at the Africa workshop.

"20 June 2019: Participants at the Sixth Meeting of the Sub-Regional Coordination Mechanism (SCRM) for North Africa agreed on a revised joint roadmap to support SDG implementation in 2019-2020, following on the creation of a draft roadmap in 2018. The SCRM is coordinated by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). The SRCM also adopted a framework to implement and monitor progress on the roadmap.In March 2018, the Fifth SRCM for North Africaagreedon a draft joint regional roadmap to support implementation of the SDGs in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia for 2018-2019. The draft roadmap focused on SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), among other SDGs, and emphasized the importance of gender as a cross-cutting dimension. The draft aimed to improve regional actors’ understanding and implementation of the SDGs, and called for including the SDGs in public policies, building statistical capacity in the region, ensuring follow-up and review on SDG implementation, and seizing additional opportunities for South-South cooperation.The two-year roadmap covers employment, food security, climate change, regional integration, and reporting on the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.UNECA’s Office for North Africa organized the Sixth SRCM meeting, which convened from 18-19 June 2019. In his opening speech, Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) Secretary-General Taïeb Baccouche said the coordination mechanism has provided “a foundation that can be progressively improved and operationalized to develop synergies” and improve the effectiveness of interventions. UNECA’s Lilia Hachem Naas underscored the importance of synergies in accelerating action to achieve the SDGs, highlighting a need for stronger information systems and innovative and strategic partnerships at all levels. Participants also supported partnerships with development banks and the private sector to mobilize financial resources in support of the SDGs.The revised roadmap for 2019-2020 covers five thematic areas: awareness raising, advocacy, monitoring and reporting on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063; employment; food security; climate change; and regional integration, including implementation of the African Free Trade Area (AFTA).

"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has released guidance to help governments measure poverty in their countries by producing granular data to identify the most vulnerable or disadvantaged groups, who often experience the highest levels of poverty. Poverty eradication is the first Goal in the 2030 Agenda: SDG 1, “end poverty in all its forms everywhere.”The statistical guidance was launched on 13 January 2021, following a 2017 UNECE guide on poverty measurement. It is intended to support governments in managing the increased demands related to identifying those most often left behind. This entails producing indicators that are disaggregated along many dimensions. Theglobal indicatorsfor the targets of SDG 1 cover age, sex, employment status, geographic location (urban/rural), disability status, migratory status, and ethnicity, among others.UNECE notes that groups who are often underrepresented in surveys and other data sources include: people without a fixed address, undocumented migrants, people living in institutions (e.g. elder care homes, children’s homes, and prisons), and marginalized ethnic minority groups.The guide covers methodological improvements, including survey methods for populations living in institutions and hard-to-reach groups, but also stresses the need for changes beyond methodology. The authors call for “strong legal and policy processes to support statistical offices in producing disaggregated poverty measures, which cannot be achieved through methodological changes alone.” [Publication:Poverty measurement: Guide to data disaggregation] [UNECE press release]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"6 September 2019: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) have published a book that aims to bring the “voices of land” restoration into the limelight and inspire partnerships that can deliver at scale. Success stories from Ecuador, Georgia, Jordan, Kenya, Madagascar and Viet Nam presented in the publication reflect how local and global collaboration to achieve land degradation neutrality (LDN) can effectively contribute to restoring the quarter of the planet’s land that is degraded.The book titled, ‘Voices From the Land: Restoring Soil and Enriching Lives,’ highlights the impact of land degradation on the well-being of over three billion people, representing almost half of the world’s population who are directly affected by it. Through the stories of people “who decided to fight back rather than become another statistic tracking poverty, conflict or forced migration,” as Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary, UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), writes in the introduction, the publication reveals the cost-effective results that can be achieved locally and scaled up globally “when the right partners come together.”Sustainably managing degraded land globally could save between USD 4.3 trillion and USD 20.2 trillion annually.The book specifically focuses on multi-stakeholder projects that, among other partners, include UNEP and GEF, capturing six stories on:Balancing climate, conflict and community in Kenya;Ranching and restoration in Ecuador;Fighting erosion in Madagascar;Restoring fortune to the fields of Georgia;Sustainable tea production in Viet Nam; andCommunity land management in Jordan.Showcasing smallholders like Khatmah who are working with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to restore traditional rangeland management in Jordan and Egypt, or tea growers like Thanh who are working with the Rainforest Alliance to restore natural soil fertility in Viet Nam, China, India and Sri Lanka, the publication makes the case for investing in the stewardship of land as an effective way to create opportunities for much wider sustainable development.In the joint introduction, Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UNEP, and Naoko Ishii, CEO and Chairperson, GEF, mention that efforts to restore the two billion hectares of degraded land globally have “enormous potential” to increase productivity, sequester carbon and preserve biodiversity, while boosting employment in rural areas, strengthening economies and creating opportunities for some of the most vulnerable categories of population. They note that restoring and sustainably managing degraded land globally could save between USD 4.3 trillion and USD 20.2 trillion annually through the provision of ecosystem services alone. To that end, Andersen and Ishii highlight the importance of facilitating partnerships that build capacities and link local will to global knowledge.

"The Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) has released the results of a study assessing the influence of environmental SDG targets on other SDGs. The study, which was undertaken at the EU level, finds that many more “promoting” than “restricting” interactions exist between the SDGs, and some of the environmental targets are important promoters of progress towards other targets and Goals.The European Environment Agency (EEA) commissioned the study, with the resultsreleasedon 29 October 2019, in the SEI report titled, ‘SDGs and the Environment in the EU: A Systems View to Improve Coherence.’ Written by Nina Weitz, Henrik Carlsen, Kristian Skånberg, Adis Dzebo and Vincent Viaud, the study is based on the SDG Synergies approach, a semi-quantitative approach developed by SEI researchers.The report finds that in the EU, the two environmental targets that seem to have the strongest synergistic potential for SDG progress are: SDG target 13.1 (strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters); and SDG target 12.4 (responsible management of chemicals and waste). While SDG target 13.1 could restrict progress on SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), it would promote progress on other Goals and targets, particularly SDG target 14.2 (sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).The authors also note that progress on four SDGs – Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Goal 10 (reduced inequalities) and Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities) – could make it more difficult to achieve SDG target 12.4.The study finds eight environment-related targets that collectively promote progress on all the other SDGs, to varying degrees. In addition to the SDG targets noted above, these are:SDG target 12.2 (sustainable management and use of natural resources);SDG target 13.2 (integrate climate change measures into policies and planning);SDG target 14.4 (sustainable fishing);SDG target 15.1 (conserve and restore terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems); andSDG target 15.5 (protect biodiversity and natural habitats).However, the collective influence of the eight targets could also be “restrictive” on seven Goals: SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 10 and SDG 11.The authors of the report point to several previous studies exploring the integrated nature of the SDGs. Per the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs and their targets are integrated and indivisible, and provide balanced representation of the three dimensions of sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda also notes the “crucial importance” of the interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs to ensure the Agenda’s realization.

"20 September 2019: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) has announced initiatives to help countries achieve universal health coverage (UHC), through policies and programmes focused on equity and human rights. Efforts relate to: reducing inequalities and exclusion; strengthening effective and inclusive governance; and building resilient and sustainable systems for health.On 24 September 2019, UN Member Statesadoptedthe first-ever global declaration on UHC, during a high-level meeting in New York, US. The political declaration seeks to enable an additional one billion people to access health services by 2023. UNDP is one of 12 global organizations cooperating with the World Health Organization (WHO) to help countries meet this commitment.In a 16-pageissue brief, UNDP points to evidence that the insufficient pace of progress towards UHC is imposing significant costs on lower- and middle-income countries, and pushing almost 100 million people into extreme poverty every year due to out-of-pocket health costs. On inequalities and exclusion, UNDP’s work focuses on eliminating sexual and gender-based violence, promoting gender equality in national HIV and other health programmes, and improving access to HIV and health services for women, girls and excluded groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) populations.On governance, UNDP is working with judges, parliamentarians and law enforcement personnel to increase sensitivity to HIV and health issues, and to implement the recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. UNDP is also supporting governments to control marketing of tobacco, alcohol and snack foods high in sugar, salt and trans fats, including through imposing taxes on sales of such items. The Programme cites calculations that the increased taxation of tobacco, alcohol and sugary beverages could avert 50 million deaths and raise USD20.5 trillion in tax revenue over 20 years. UNDP is also working on partnerships to make “micro health insurance” available to some of the poorest populations, so that they will have access to health services when they need it.On health systems, UNDP is building capacity within countries for: financial and risk management, procurement of health commodities, monitoring and evaluation, introduction of digital systems, and policy management. This includes working in fragile states to integrate health into conflict and disaster recovery efforts.The issue brief provides several examples of large-scale, systemic responses to UHC challenges, including UNDP’s “solar for health” initiative to ensure stable electricity supply to hospitals, and the establishment of a multi-stakeholder alliance to promote anti-corruption, transparency and accountability measures in health systems.UHC is part of SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing); SDG target 3.8 expresses commitment to UHC through financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services, and access to essential medicines and vaccines.

"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) released guidance to help national statistical offices (NSOs) with the production of leading, composite and sentiment (LCS) indicators to better measure economic and social well-being and trends. The document provides a typology of indicators as well as country examples to inspire NSOs to develop and communicate LCS indicators.According to the ‘Guidelines on producing leading, composite and sentiment indicators’ released on 7 November 2019, leading indicators are constructed based on one or several individual indicators that together have a leading property compared to a chosen reference series, such as gross domestic product (GDP).The SDGs include several LCS indicators, including sentiment indicators on food insecurity and perceived security.Composite indicators seek to measure multi-dimensional phenomena by combining individual indicators into a single measure using statistical methods. Sentiment indicators reflect the attitudes, perceptions or expectations of groups of respondents and tend to be based on qualitative surveys that ask opinions on past, present or future developments. The type of information collected through LCS indicators has not traditionally been covered by NSOs, but demand for them has increased in the last decade to support policymaking.According to the Guidelines, some LCS indicators “will fully serve their purpose only once they are internationally comparable,” and such indicators will be useful in relation to the SDGs. Several SDG indicators, for example, are LCS indicators, including sentiment indicators on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (SDG indicator 2.1.2) and perceived security (SDG indicator 16.1.4).UNECE’s guidance document provides a structured decision-making process based on the Principles of Official Statistics for NSOs to use when deciding whether to engage in producing LCS indicators. Key steps are: engaging with users and stakeholders; analyzing possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT); and considering the opportunities and challenges of LCS indicators. Strengths to consider include the advantages of NSOs compared to other organizations in producing LCS indicators, including statistical and methodological expertise, and general trust in NSOs as providers of high-quality and impartial statistics.In addition, the Guidelines share practical guidance on how to produce and communicate LCS indicators. They recommend incorporating communication at the beginning of the statistical production process to maximize user engagement and value and ensure that LCS indicator design best reflects user needs and expertise. The Guidance also addresses indicators’ relevance, accuracy and reliability, coherence and comparability, accessibility and clarity, and timeliness and punctuality.An international Task Force established by the Conference of European Statistics (CES) in 2016 worked to develop the Guidelines. The Task Force includes representatives from Denmark, France, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden, Turkey, Eurostat, the UN Statistical Division and independent experts. The CES endorsed the Guidelines in June 2019.

"The Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI), which supports the coordination of international support to developing countries on forest monitoring and greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, has announced the launch of a new portal. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN (FAO) refers to the portal as a “one-stop shop” for information on more than 400 forest monitoring activities in 70 developing countries across Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.TheGFOI Inventory of Activitiesoffers users the opportunity to search for information by country or region, by type of forest monitoring activities, and by donors. GFOI activities fall into five categories including (1) facilitating country-led assessments of forest monitoring needs and gaps; (2) harmonized work planning to address country-identified priorities; and (3) collaborative implementation of forest monitoring support; (4) fostering a diverse network of experts and practitioners to support developing countries in a targeted and cohesive manner; and (5) facilitating information sharing between partners to avoid duplication and overlap.The portal is meant to help stakeholders identify gaps, share resources, avoid overlaps and explore opportunities for new partnerships in the development of National Forest Monitoring Systems. It is also meant to support reporting on progress towards the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and other development goals and priorities.Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States’ SilvaCarbon Programme, the International Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), the European Space Agency (ESA), FAO and the World Bank partnered to design and populate the portal.

"The Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) has released a call to action to bring about a climate-resilient recovery from the COVID-19 global pandemic, which urges governments to leverage COVID-19-related stimulus packages to invest in climate resilience.The Commission recommends that governments and organizations integrate climate resilience into all decisions and invest in innovative solutions to address both the pandemic and the climate crisis. The Commission emphasizes that adaptation investments deliver higher returns while preempting the destructive impact of future shocks. The Call to Action laments that most countries have not incorporated climate resilience into the USD 10 trillion of public funds thus far invested in pandemic crisis relief, and warns that resulting debt may restrict governments’ ability to address future climate resilience needs. The Commission also warns that the pandemic has the potential to drive 100 million more people into extreme poverty by the end of 2020, and calls on governments and donors to direct recovery aid to the world’s most vulnerable.The Commission calls on world leaders to respond to the pandemic by accelerating progress in seven areas, and articulates opportunities to do so, which, it states, “align with and support internationally agreed frameworks” such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), “while prioritizing an equitable and resilient recovery.” The seven areas are: locally led adaptation; urban resilience; water resources management; shock-responsive social safety nets; food security; nature-based solutions; and disaster prevention.In addition to former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation co-founder Bill Gates, who co-chair the Global Commission, some of the notable signatories include UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen, Global Environment Facility (GEF) CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii, and World Resources Institute (WRI) President and CEO Andrew Steer.The GCA was launched in 2018 with the mandate to encourage the development of measures to manage the effects of climate change through technology, planning, and investment. The GCA 17 convening countries and 28 commissioners represent all sectors of the globe and all sectors of development and industry. The Commission will report on progress towards advancing action in the seven areas at the January 2021 Climate Adaptation Summit in the Netherlands, and will carry its recommendations forward at COP 26 in Glasgow, UK.

"At the first part of the 26th annual session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA-26), the ISA Council’s substantive discussions focused on the draft regulations for the exploitation of mineral resources in the Area (the draft exploitation regulations). “The Area” is defined as the seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, and its “resources” as all solid, liquid, or gaseous mineral resourcesin situin the Area at or beneath the seabed.Once the regulations are concluded, they will govern future activities in the Area. Negotiators are striving to ensure the regulations provide environmental protection while balancing stakeholders’ interests.During the ISA-26 talks, which took place from 17-21 February 2020, in Kingston, Jamaica, delegates also engaged in discussions over new proposals on regional environmental management plans (REMPs), which ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge described as “one of the most important work streams of the ISA over the last two years.” Furthermore, they discussed the financial model for mineral exploitation in the Area, agreeing to convene a fourth meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) to further this work.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinsummaryof the meeting notes that delegates were reminded that the self-imposed deadline for completing the exploitation regulations is 2020, which has put the ISA Council “under pressure to agree on a mining code. Further, while the commercial viability of exploitation of minerals from the deep sea depends on many factors, from technology to mineral prices, contractors and sponsoring states are eager for the clarity that a regulatory code would provide.” At the same time, some members and observers have stressed the need for marine scientific research and adequate stakeholder engagement, to ensure environmental protection and conservation.The second part of the Council session is scheduled to take place in July 2020. [Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of ISA-26]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"23 September 2019: Described as the first financial sector-led initiative aimed at addressing climate resilience challenges, the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment (CCRI) was launched on the margins of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit. The Coalition’s goal is to develop and pilot the first framework for pricing physical climate risks in infrastructure investing.According to CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), companies are estimating a potential USD 250 billion in lost assets because of climate change, while USD 1 trillion is said to be at risk over the next five years, with the financial services industry accounting for 80% of that exposure.The Coalition’s objective is to limit the estimated loss of USD 1 trillion that is at risk over the next five years by addressing the “real systemic failure” of markets around the world to factor in physical climate-related risks into investment decisions. Building on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), CCRI targets an estimated USD 90 trillion that is earmarked globally for infrastructure up to 2030, of which about 70% is expected to go to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) whose societies and economies are typically more exposed to climate risks. The Coalition will specifically work with climate-vulnerable countries to attract investment in climate-resilient infrastructure.CCRI is chaired by John Haley, CEO of Willis Towers Watson, and brings together over 30 finance and investment organizations with more than USD 8 trillion in assets under management, to develop practical solutions to advance climate change resilience. It receives support from, among others, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Governments of the UK and Jamaica, and the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA).A related initiative launched at the Climate Action Summit, the InsuResilience Global Partnership, seeks to shield vulnerable populations from the economic burden of climate impacts by ensuring that 500 million poor and vulnerable people worldwide are covered against climate shocks by prearranged risk finance by 2025. The initiative is funded by the Governments of Germany and the UK, with the private insurance industry committing up to USD 5 billion of risk capacity until 2025.

"The IISD has published a policy brief on the role of finance and technology in achieving sustainable development. The brief warns that while the world has enough money to fund sustainable development, there is a financing gap and a persistent digital divide to achieve the SDGs.The brief, authored by Elena Kosolapova, argues that “technology, finance, and capacity building, together with inclusive and equitable globalization and trade, regional integration, and enabling environments” can help address climate change, biodiversity loss, growing inequalities, poverty, and hunger, among other challenges. It acknowledges that without transferring technological and financial resources to developing countries, the world cannot achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.The brief traces the history of sustainable development finance since the UN Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, and outlines the current global regulatory landscape for financing sustainable development and climate action, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the Paris Agreement.According to the brief, “financing remains a major bottleneck”— a challenge exacerbated by “slow growth, high debt, growing trade restrictions, increasing environmental shocks, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” It argues the world could bridge the financing gap to achieve the SDGs, estimated at between USD 2.5 and USD 3 trillion per year, if about 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) went to sustainable development. However, “‘substantial backsliding in key action areas’ has been observed,” the brief warns, including a drop in official development assistance (ODA) of 4.3% in 2018, and a decrease in ODA to least developed countries (LDCs) of 2.2% in real terms. The brief notes that “developed countries’ pledge of raising USD 100 billion per year in climate finance has also proven difficult to achieve.”The brief outlines “persistent gaps” between developed and developing countries’ access to and use of existing technologies, and points to “a persistent digital divide.” Recognizing technologies’ potential to “promote sustainable development and leave no one behind,” the brief cautions about possible risks that could compromise achievement of the SDGs, such as exacerbated inequalities and job loss, and recommends any tradeoffs be addressed.Improved alignment between development cooperation and climate action, the brief argues, “can help ensure development financing activities do not undermine sustainable development,” which, it says, can be achieved though leadership, renewed commitment, political will, and global partnership.The brief was published as part of the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series, which assesses “the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy,” focusing on climate action,sustainable energy,wildlife trade, andbiodiversity, among other issues.

"Out of the 156 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted to date, 135 countries mention renewables. However, most of these are underutilizing the potential of renewables to raise their ambition according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). A joint event with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) on the sidelines of UNFCCC COP 25 emphasized that the energy transition is achievable if renewable energy becomes an integral part of countries’ climate pledges.The discussion on 11 December 2019 explored opportunities to strengthen renewable targets in the post-2020 NDCs to achieve multiple benefits, including decarbonizing energy use, and simultaneously achieve multiple SDGs. IRENA has reported that eliminating fossil fuel subsidies could generate the bulk of USD 1.7 trillion required annually until 2030, and accelerate renewables’ deployment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The event also launched anIRENA reporttitled, ‘NDCs in 2020: Advancing Renewables in the Power Sector and Beyond,’ which estimates that renewable deployment would have to accelerate six-fold by 2030 if the world is to achieve the goal of cutting global carbon emissions by 45% and keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.The report also finds that:More extensive renewable power deployment, amounting to 7.7 TW (or 3.3 times current global capacity), could be achieved cost-effectively and would bring considerable socio-economic benefits.Existing NDC power targets “overlook 59% of the potential for renewable electricity deployment in line with the Paris Agreement by 2030,” and even fall increasingly short of national strategies and plans. Aligning the next round of NDCs closely to existing national plans could increase global renewable power capacity to 5.2 TW (or 2.2 times current global capacity) by 2030.To date, only 85 countries included unconditional renewable power pledges in their current NDCs, compared to 135 with non-NDC domestic renewable power targets (either national or sub-national).NDCs thus far do not reflect the actual growth of renewable power, with global capacity growing by 8.6% per year since 2015.Implementing current NDCs would only translate into annual capacity growth of 4% for 2015–2030, even though annual renewable power growth already averaged 5.9% in 2010–2014. With current deployment trends, the 3.2 TW foreseen in current NDC power targets for 2030 could be reached by 2022.The report emphasizes that power sector decarbonization alone will not suffice to meet Paris Agreement objectives. The authors call for a profound transformation through the adoption of renewables and energy efficiency measures, as well as increased electrification of end uses.The two agencies also showcased support available to countries, including: the IRENA-UNDP global campaign#ItsPossible, which engages policymakers and investors to join a push for renewables; andClimate Promise, a UNDP-led initiative to support 100 countries to accelerate the enhancement of national climate pledges by 2020, with IRENA providing technical support to accelerate countries’ energy transitions.

"3 September 2019: President Emmanuel Macron of France has signed a letter of intent committing US$65 million dollars to support forest conservation and conserve peatlands in the Republic of the Congo. The commitment is part of the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), of which France holds the Presidency for in 2019.According to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP), the Republic of the Congo’s forests cover 23.9 million hectares. The country’s peatlands, which were discovered in 2017, can play a critically important role in addressing climate change and maintaining biodiversity. The Republic of Congo’s vision is to maintain a low deforestation rate while diversifying its economy. In 2018, a ministerial decree restricted agro-industrial exploitation to savannah areas, as part of the country’s broader efforts to promote sustainable forest and peatland management and to contribute towards sustainable development and efforts to combat climate change.The letter of intent establishes a long-term partnership to implement the Investment Plan of the Republic of Congo’s national REDD+ Strategy under CAFI. The agreement identifies an opportunity to address biodiversity loss and climate change and work towards the achievement of the SDGs, including SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), through strengthened international cooperation on conserving the Republic of Congo’s forests. Under the agreement, the Republic of Congo commits to avoid conversion of over 20,000 hectares of forest annually and to implement measures to improve forest governance, including tackling illegal logging. The agreement will also support the protection of peatlands by prohibiting their drainage and drying.France, Norway and the European Union (EU) will contribute US$45 million to the agreement. In addition, the French Development Agency (AFD), the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the German Federal Ministry of the Environment (BMU) will contribute US$45 million.This Letter of Intent with the Republic of Congo is the third signed between CAFI and its partner countries. CAFI signed a Letter of Intent with the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 and with Gabon in 2017. CAFI supports national investment frameworks based on Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) and focuses on six high forest cover countries in the Central Africa Region.

"The UN Human Rights Committee has issued its first ruling on a request for asylum from the effects of climate change. The request came from a Kiribati citizen who had taken refuge in New Zealand, but in 2015 his asylum application was denied and he was deported to Kiribati.TheHuman Rights Committeeincludes 18 independent human rights experts from around the world, and it serves to monitor the adherence of States parties to theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).Ioane Teitiota’s case argued that Kiribati had become uninhabitable for all residents because of the rise in sea level and other climate change effects, leading to violent land disputes, saltwater contamination of the freshwater supply, and resulting difficulty in subsistence farming.In a ruling issued on 7 January 2020, the body found that countries may not deport individuals facing “climate change-induced conditions that violate the right to life.” The Committee states that the ruling “sets forth new standards that could facilitate the success of future climate change-related asylum claims,” and individuals can seek protection from both sudden-onset and slow-onset processes related to climate change. They do not need to prove that they would face imminent harm in their countries.The Committee writes that it accepts Teitiota’s claim that sea-level rise is likely to render Kiribati uninhabitable within ten or 15 years. However, there is time for “intervening acts” by the Kiribati government with assistance from the international community to protect and/or relocate its population. Indeed, the Committee recognizes that the Republic of Kiribati is taking adaptive measures to reduce its vulnerability and built its resilience to climate change-related harms.

In order to keep the lights on, so to speak, delegations undertook a virtual decision making process in November for:The second extraordinary meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties (ExCOP 2);The first extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CP ExCOP/MOP 1); andThe first extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) (NP ExCOP/MOP 1).The draft budget was agreed via silence procedure on 27 November 2020. The interim budget for 2021 consists of “old” and “new” monies. The old monies involve the extension of the validity of funds allocated in the 2019-2020 budget associated with the costs of the meetings of the COP and its subsidiary bodies that were postponed due to the pandemic. The new monies include the approval, on an exceptional basis, a core 2021 programme budget.When COP 15 convenes in 2021, parties will have an ambitious agenda: to “do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change in 2015,” in the words of UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir. As the ENB reports, “all of the 2010-2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets have been missed, making it even more important to ramp up collective ambition and willingness to do better in defining and implementing goals and targets for the next decade.”The ENB notes that regardless of whether negotiations must continue taking place virtually, or in-person meetings are able to resume, a legitimate and effective post-2020 framework will require equitable representation by parties, organizations, and other stakeholders.

"23 September 2019: A global initiative, launched under the Industry Transition Track of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit, will help guide the world’s heaviest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting industries towards the low-carbon economy. The ‘Leadership Group for Industry Transition’ will drive transformation in hard-to-decarbonize and energy-intensive sectors.The Group was announced by India and Sweden, with Argentina, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea and the UK, and a group of companies, including Dalmia Cement, DSM, Heathrow Airport, LKAB, Mahindra Group, Royal Schiphol Group, Scania, SpiceJet, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp and Vattenfall.Supported by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Energy Transitions Commission, Mission Innovation, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the European Climate Foundation, among other partners, the Group will engage in an ambitious, public-private effort to ensure that heavy industries and mobility companies “can find a workable pathway to deliver” on the Paris Agreement on climate change.Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, India, expressed hope that work under the Industry Transition Track will “facilitate early diffusion of technology and support to developing countries.” Welcoming the partnership, WEF Founder and Executive Chairman, Klaus Schwab, said the Forum will help India, Sweden and other partners to “deploy the innovative models and technologies we know are needed to solve our most complex and stubborn carbon emission reduction challenges.”According to a Climate Action Summit press release, the heavy industry sector, including hard-to-abate and energy-intensive sectors like steel, cement, aluminum, aviation and shipping, is expected to be responsible for 15.7 gigatons (Gt) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Therefore, “international collaboration between countries and industry groups is critical to establish workable policy frameworks and incentives and to enable joint investment into low-carbon infrastructure” in order to reduce emissions and accelerate transition to low-carbon industrial development while pursuing efforts to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

"5 July 2019: A group of scientists and experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and ETH Zurich identified nearly one billion hectares of degraded land and forests that could be restored to help tackle climate change, and proposed country-level targets for forest restoration.In an article inSciencemagazine titled, ‘The Global Tree Restoration Potential,’ the scientists used direct measurements of forest cover to generate an open-access map that shows forest restoration potential around the world. The map shows “how much additional tree cover could exist outside of forests and agricultural and urban land,” illustrating the potential for the world’s ecosystems to support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forests. Such an increase in forests could reduce atmospheric carbon by about 25 percent while increasing forested areas by over 25 percent. The authors identify global tree restoration “as our most effective climate change solution to date.”However, the authors caution that climate change is predicted to have an effect on this potential tree coverage. They state that if the world does not shift from its current trajectory, the global potential tree canopy cover could decrease by approximately 223 million hectares by 2050. The majority of tree cover losses are predicted to occur in the tropics. The authors conclude that there is an “urgent need for action” to harness the potential of global tree restoration to support climate change mitigation.“We already know that restoration can help to reduce biodiversity loss, climate change and rural poverty,” Tiina Vähänen, FAO, explained, but the effects of forest restoration take time to materialize. She called for acting “quickly and effectively to restore areas with appropriate trees and other plants.” [Publication:The Global Tree Restoration Potential] [FAO Press Release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
"10 July 2019: A side event at the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) discussed how fossil fuel subsidy (FFS) reform can help to scale up climate ambition (SDG 13) and contribute to achievement of several other SDGs, including poverty reduction (SDG 1), health and well-being (SDG 3), energy (SDG 7) and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).Initial findings were presented from an integrated fiscal model developed by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) to analyze the effects of FFS reform, fuel taxation, and resource reallocation to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The analysis shows that the effects of FFS reform would contribute to cumulative savings of carbon dioxide (CO2) of 4.8 gigatonnes (Gt) from across all 26 countries covered.A focus on decarbonization pathways and access to energy for all is necessary to understand potential co-benefits, as well as trade-offs.During a panel discussion exploring some challenges and opportunities of FFS reform, speakers noted that 40% of global energy still comes from coal, which hampers achievement of SDG 7. Peter Messerli, Co-Chair, UN Global Sustainable Development Report, emphasized that a focus on decarbonization pathways and access to energy for all is necessary to understand potential co-benefits, as well as trade-offs required, and cautioned that transformation of the energy system needs to be handled with care.Highlighting parallels with agricultural subsidies reform, Satya Tripathi, Assistant UN Secretary General and Head of the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) New York Office, noted how the Zero Budget Natural Farming method in India has helped to reduce subsidies for chemical fertilizers and farmers’ debts.The discussions underscored the importance of linking FFS reform to transformation of the entire energy system. Noting that finance and inequalities remain at the core of the problem, participants provided suggestions on critical actions required, including: attaining more transparency, especially on producer subsidies; supporting governments to undertake self- and peer-review of subsidies; looking at opportunities for subsidy swaps; and considering co-benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and including FFS reform in second generation Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).The side event was convened by the Permanent Mission of Switzerland, and co-sponsored by Costa Rica, New Zealand, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform (FFFsR), UNEP, and IISD GSI.

"4 September 2019: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) has released a proposed set of standards to guide private fund managers towards investments that advance the SDGs. The standards are open for comment and consultation through 4 December 2019.The proposed standards titled, ‘SDG Impact Practice Standards for Private Equity Funds,’ aim to help the private sector move from interest in the SDGs to adopting good practice on SDG investments. The standards facilitate implementation of existing principles, and are expected to inform performance reporting and benchmarking. The standards provide practical guidance for the private sector to operationalize the SDGs using a checklist to integrate impact into private equity fund design and execution.To encourage consistent application, the standards complement and are mapped to existing frameworks and principles for sustainable impact investment, including the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Principles for Responsible Banking, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Operating Principles for Impact Management, Principles for Positive Impact Finance and the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) Core Characteristics for Impact Investors.Mobilizing an additional 5% of global assets under management yearly in ways that take us closer to the SDGs is a realistic goal.There are 18 standards, grouped among three categories: standards for strategic intent and goal setting; standards for impact measurement and management; and standards for transparency and accountability. To assess strategic intent and goal setting, for example, standards examine the fund’s motivations for engaging with the SDGs, determine its SDG impact intentions and its theory of change, among other areas. For each standard, there are a series of tests to assess the core elements of that standard and determine the extent to which each fund attains or does not attain the particular standard. The standards provide guidance on what each level of attainment should look like, including sample text.The UNDP proposed standards include a tiered certification framework to recognize and differentiate good practice in the market, with an “SDG Impact Seal” that can be awarded based on achieving certification criteria. The three certification tiers aim to “meet the market where it is” and provide a structure for improvement. UNDP is inviting feedback on the proposed levels of attainment.Elizabeth Boggs-Davidsen, UNDP SDG Impact Director, reflected that there has been strong and growing private sector enthusiasm for the SDGs but that “translating interest into action has been challenging.” She identified a need to accelerate SDG implementation, and said “mobilizing an additional 5% of global assets under management yearly (about USD 6 trillion) in ways that take us closer to the SDGs is a realistic goal.”SDG Impact, an initiative of UNDP, developed the standards as part of a suite of services that aim to help investors to engage with SDG-enabling opportunities and differentiate impact practices through certification. Following the finalization of the standards, SDG Impact will develop UNDP Practice Standards for Bonds and Enterprises.

"The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation issued the second progress report on the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. The 2020 update highlights efforts to incorporate recycled content into plastic packaging and phase out single-use plastic bags and straws. The authors call for an international framework on plastic pollution.The 2020 progress report towards the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment finds that “much more must be done, and at greater speed” to tackle plastic pollution and achieve the 2025 targets of the Commitment. Although progress has been made on incorporating recycled content in plastic packaging and phasing out the most commonly identified items, like single-use plastic bags and straws, PS and PVC packaging, and undetectable carbon black pigments, there has been limited progress in other areas. Progress is limited on shifting towards reusable packaging and increasing the recyclability of plastic packaging. On eliminating the need for single-use packaging, efforts have focused on a small set of formats and materials, and substituting other plastics or paper rather than reducing the need for single-use packaging.The report finds “substantial differences in progress between signatories” to the Commitment towards their 2025 targets on a circular economy for plastics. For example:The Coca-Cola Company is 99% of the way towards achieving its 2025 packaging design target;Of the signatories for packaged goods and retail, 31% have established targets to reduce virgin plastic in packaging or eliminate plastic packaging;On reuse, 39% of signatories are testing and piloting models, including a few that reported large numbers of pilots: Natura Cosmetics (24), L’Oreal (22), Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (10) and Unilever (9); andOther signatories have shown little to no progress on quantitative targets; the report states many businesses will need to accelerate their efforts to meet their 2025 targets.The report concludes with four calls to action for businesses and governments. Businesses are urged to: take bold action on packaging types that are not recycled today, either decisively innovating away from them or developing and implementing a roadmap to make recycling work; and set ambitious reduction targets that recognize that “voluntary action by industry alone” will not be sufficient.The authors call on governments to: set global direction and create an international framework for action through the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA), building on the vision of a circular economy for plastics; and establish mechanisms and policies that provide dedicated, stable funding for collection and sorting, including through fair industry contributions, as recycling is “unlikely to ever scale” without such action.The 2020 report uses 2019 data; the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet reflected in the numbers in the report. The report observes that the pandemic “has without doubt had an impact on the plastics system in 2020” and future reports are expected to report on this impact. The authors add that the pandemic presents an opportunity to address plastic pollution and climate change in recovery efforts. [UNEP press release] [Ellen MacArthur Foundation press release] [Report Landing Page] [Publication:New Plastics Economy Global Commitment Progress report for 2020]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"9 September 2019: The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) launched its refugee education strategy to guide the implementation of agreed targets under SDG 4 (quality education) and the 2016 Global Compact on Refugees. The strategy promotes refugee inclusion in national education systems and safe environments for all students. It aims to enable learners to use their education towards sustainable futures.UNHCR developed the strategy through a two-year consultative process with other UN agencies, international organizations, multilateral organizations, governments, education networks, the private sector and refugee communities themselves. The strategy is an update of the agency’s 2012-2016 Refugee Education Strategy, and it reflects contemporary understanding that refugees and displaced persons are often unable to return home for long periods, and that earlier, short-term approaches to refugee education have been insufficient. In view of the rapidly evolving displacement situation worldwide, the strategy was launched as a ‘living document’ online that can be complemented by further documentation of good practices, case studies and other guidance.The strategy document titled, ‘Refugee Education 2030: A Strategy for Refugee Inclusion,’ contains many examples of successful efforts to improve education opportunities for refugee and other displaced children and youth around the world. On inclusion in national education systems, for example, UNHCR has encouraged informal learning centers in Malaysia, where there are 30,000 refugee children of school age, to adopt the Malaysian national curriculum, provide classes in the national language, and administer testing aligned to national standards. This approach has resulted in the Ministry of Education recognizing and registering 25 learning centers where Rohingya children are being educated, paving the way for their inclusion in the national system.The overall goals of the strategy support those of the Global Compact on Refugees to: ease the pressures on host countries; enhance refugee self-reliance; and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity. The document sets out recommended actions for all education actors, including governments, intergovernmental and regional organizations, donors, multilateral and bilateral organizations, NGOs, the private sector, and individual philanthropists. Five appendices provide a breakdown of objectives and expected results, approaches to achieving the objectives, and details of relevant international policy frameworks.

"23 September 2019: The Government of Uruguay has developed a climate action plan to deal with the impacts of climate change faced by the agriculture sector, which will also help the country achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and the SDGs.The ‘Uruguayan National Adaptation Plan to Climate Variability and Change for the Agricultural Sector’ (NAP-Agro) proposes a strategy for 2050 and an action plan for 2025, with adaptation measures focused on production systems, ecosystems and natural resources, livelihoods and institutional capacities.The Plan seeks to increase the adaptive capacity and resilience and improve the livelihoods of rural populations through adopting sustainable animal and plant production systems, developing and transferring technology, information systems, climate insurance, resilient infrastructure, promoting best practices, supporting networks and organizations of farmers and strengthening institutional capacities for adaptation.The NAP-Agro was developed following a decade of studies and research that helped improve decision making on adaptation actions and formulate the NAP. Studies include: a case study on Uruguay, ‘Safeguarding Livelihoods and Promoting Resilience Through National Adaptation Plans,’ and ‘Making the Case for Gender-responsive Adaptation Planning in Uruguay: The Importance of Sex-disaggregated Data’; guides onapplying cost-benefit analysisto adaptation measures in agriculture and forestimating losses and damagesdue to extreme climatic events in agriculture (in Spanish); and studies ongender and adaptationto climate change in agriculture and onclimate projectionsthrough statistical downscaling (in Spanish).The formulation of the NAP-Agro is the result of a three-year participatory process, which involved more than 950 people, to identify, order and prioritize climate actions. In 2017, a consultation process through a series of Adaptation Dialogues involved more than 200 people from the private and public sectors, academia and civil society. These Dialogues identified impacts of climate variability and change and priority adaptation strategies focusing on different productive systems, rural women and family farming. Adaptation workshops also took place in agricultural high schools across Uruguay, with nearly 450 youth participating. In July, the draft NAP-Agro received comments from stakeholders from public agricultural institutions, subnational governments, civil society, farmer organizations and academia.The process was led by the Office of Agricultural Programming and Policy of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, in coordination with the National System of Response to Climate Change and Variability. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) provided technical support, under the Integrating Agriculture into National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Program funded by the Government of Germany.

"25 July 2019: The city of Almaty, Kazakhstan, has commissioned a report on opportunities for developing a circular economy at the municipal level. The report, prepared by a consortium of not-for-profit organizations, proposes various options for moving towards circularity in the city’s agriculture and food processing, construction, and other industries.Steps towards a circular economy may enhance efforts on achieving SDG target 12.5, which seeks to substantially reduce waste generation by 2020 through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.The 116-page report titled, ‘Circular Economy Opportunities in Almaty: A Metabolic Approach to Define a Resource Efficient and Low-carbon Future for the City,’ shows what a circular economy could look like in various sectors.On agriculture and food processing, the report notes the country’s intention to almost double its agricultural production and processing capacity by 2020, and calls for planning ahead to make use of the increased waste streams that will be generated from such activity. Current initiatives that promote circularity include using chicken manure and straw for mushroom production, and heating greenhouses with gas generated from other activities. Recommendations focus on organic resources, and also consider the life cycles of food, drinking water, and associated packaging. The Circle Economy, one of the consortium members behind the report, highlighted in a press release that the most promising opportunities may be in diverting organic residues away from landfills and using them to promote soil quality.On construction, the report recommends designing buildings for energy efficiency, designing buildings to allow for modular and flexible assembly, and introducing policies that favor the use of approaches with the least possible environmental impacts.On industry, the report suggests that the municipality provides physical space to projects in creative design, repair, recycling, and repurposing of waste materials.Finally, it recommends convening private- and public-sector stakeholders to promote circularity, and to put in place measures for an independent entity to track progress by monitoring resource flows and quantities.Almaty is the first Central Asian city to commission such a report. The Circle Economy is a membership-based organization with the mission to enable municipalities to promote the transition from a linear to a circular economy. A research report published earlier this year by the Circle Economy argues that municipalities and governments are responsible to create the conditions for the circular economy to thrive, and suggests that such a transition could create many new jobs. The Circle Economy’s mission is to accelerate the transition to circularity through the development of practical and scalable solutions and international campaigns.

"The Center for Global Development introduced an idea for a “stretch fund” to bridge the SDG financing gap. The fund would fill in a “missing piece” in the development finance architecture, by partnering with development finance institutions to stretch the spectrum of clients, scale and mobilization of finance, range of investments and scope of investible markets.In a brief titled, ‘The Stretch Fund: Bridging the Gap in the Development Finance Architecture,’ Nancy Lee and Dan Preston recognize that development finance institutions (DFIs) have a similar view of risk and tolerance for risk as their commercial counterparts. Consequently, DFIs have faced challenges in developing “projects that will pass their own credit and investment committees.” The authors identify three gaps that DFIs and private investors typically do not address: early-stage finance for firms and infrastructure; high-risk project tranches; and local currency products and services. They propose a new approach that can help DFIs effectively manage increased risk while increasing their impact.To bridge the SDG financing gap, the authors argue, the world needs a “new public-private actor…one that has a very different risk tolerance and financial objective” and that prioritizes development impact. Lee and Preston emphasize the a critical need for public or private investors that are willing to target investments with high development impact and at scale, but also are willing to accept below-market returns.They outline the ways in which the Stretch Fund would differ from existing DFIs and their donor trust fund partners, including by deploying subordinated products and aligning staff performance incentives with an impact mission and a tolerance for a portfolio with financial underperformers. The proposed Stretch Fund would be a pooled investment vehicle, with a focus on transactions under USD10 million and a “substantial share of activity involving deals in the USD2 to USD4 million range.” They recommend that Stretch Fund’s targeted size be approximately USD500 million, with varying sizes of capital infusions from about ten donor governments and philanthropic organizations. The authors suggest that the instrument mix be approximately 55% equity, 35% debt and 10% guarantees.Lee and Preston conclude that the Stretch Fund presents an opportunity to change the SDG financing dynamics and help bridge critical gaps that block private finance flows in a way that will boost leverage and impact.

"The third edition of the Paris Peace Forum brought together heads of state and international organizations and representatives from local and national governments, civil society, youth, the private sector, philanthropy, academia, and other stakeholders to work on the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic and consider ways to improve resilience and rebuild a more sustainable world.The Forum convened in a virtual format from 11-13 November 2020.Debates focused on the role multilateral action can play to enhance action in a number of areas, including: addressing challenges posed by climate change, new technologies, migration, and global inequalities; improving biodiversity governance; and strengthening South-South platforms. Dedicated sessions addressed, among other topics, drug policy and public health, conserving nature to avoid pandemics, city action towards a green and equitable recovery, supporting vulnerable populations during pandemics, and education in the post-COVID-19 era.Addressing the Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterrescalledfor fully integrating climate and environmental action into stimulus packages to rebuild sustainable and inclusive economies and societies. He proposed three “lines of action” to put the world on a trajectory towards limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels:Mobilization of a “global coalition for carbon neutrality” in 2021 to “leap forward towards carbon neutrality,” while taking into account “the common but differentiated responsibilities of one and all”;More preventive action, including through channeling more finance to adaptation; andEnhancing private and public financing for climate action.The Forum included theFinance in Common Summitwhere representatives from multilateral development banks (MDBs) explored pathways towards economic and social recovery while redoubling efforts to achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.Private sector actors joined the business track of the Paris Peace Forum to improve the collective response and resilience to the pandemic, while reforming production and trade systems at the same time.Several initiatives were launched during the Forum. The Ministerial Meeting of the Alliance for Multilateralism launched the ‘One Health’ High Level Expert Council, which will “aim to gather and disseminate reliable information on the links between human, animal, and environmental health in a context of biodiversity erosion.”The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP)launchedtheOECD-UNDP Framework for SDG Aligned Financeto help public and private actors identify and prioritize investments that contribute to the SDGs.The Paris Peace Forum is an annual event that focuses on governance solutions in the areas of peace and security, development, environment, new technologies, inclusive economy, and culture and education.

Agenda items that were discussed and kept open for MOP 31’s further consideration included:unexpected emissions of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11);terms of reference (ToR) for the study on the 2021-2023 replenishment of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol;review of the ToR, composition, balance, fields of expertise and workload of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP); andToR for the 2022 Quadrennial Assessment.Agenda items whose discussions were concluded at OEWG 41 and noted in the meeting report include: risk of non-compliance with hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) production and consumption reduction targets by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; and safety standards.TheEarth Negotiations Bulletinanalysis looks at the Montreal Protocol’s more than 30-year history of surmounting challenges, including those related to an “old” or “settled” subject such as CFC-11, by channeling the guiding principles and practices of the Montreal Protocol: trust in science; trust among Parties; and trust in the Protocol itself. It highlights that “a number of Parties lamented that an inordinate amount of time has been occupied at OEWG 41, and will be required at MOP 31, to continue to address the illegal usage of CFC-11.” It notes that the commitment to support other Parties exemplifies the trust that Parties have historically had in each other and the continued desire to preserve this trust.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has issued an information note that articulates how temporary border closures and travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have affected goods and services trade.The note describes how far-reaching travel bans in the early months of the virus’s spread “have given way to more fine-tuned policies” that enable essential workers to travel and create “travel bubbles” among partners such that quarantines are not considered necessary. Despite these changes however, the note emphasizes that barriers to mobility have significantly impacted the tourism and education services sectors, as well as goods trade.The authors underscore that international trade and investment have always relied on the cross-border mobility of individuals. Referencing theGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services(GATS), which defines trade in services in terms of four modes of supply, the information note describes how each mode has been impacted by cross-border mobility restrictions, with the caveat that these modes are often bundled and feature varying degrees of substitutability.For economies dependent on tourism, the sector has turned from a source of growth into a vulnerability.The note finds the most severe impacts on services traded through consumption abroad (GATS mode 2). This mode includes services trade that requires physical proximity between producers and consumers (e.g. tourism and in-person higher education). Mobility-related measures have shut down the tourism sector in developed and developing economies alike, and for the latter, have “turned a source of growth into a vulnerability.”On services traded through the movement of natural persons (GATS mode 4), which includes services that rely on cross-border movement of individuals (e.g. professional and other business services), the note describes COVID-19’s impacts as “devastating.” Noting that the majority of business travel has ceased, according to a study conducted in May 2020 by the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), the authors report that given the proliferation of videoconferencing tools, it is difficult to gauge whether online supply presents “a longer-term substitution of mode 4 trade.”While the information note finds that the remaining two GATS modes are not as significantly impacted, services provision through the establishment of a commercial presence abroad (GATS mode 3), or from one country to another through the online provision of services (GATS mode 1), individual mobility remains a factor. Regardless of mode, the authors expect that face-to-face interactions will continue to play a role in services provision.The note also highlights that international cooperation efforts have served to mitigate harmful economic impacts, and that lessons learned in recent months can “help WTO members foster greater resilience” to future shocks. Information exchange, the note emphasizes, will be critical to identifying ways of protecting public health while minimizing “trade-distortive effects.”Looking ahead, the note projects that restarting international mobility of individuals is unlikely to proceed in a linear fashion. Reemphasizing the importance of a collaborative approach, the note concludes that measures impacting transnational mobility have “obvious cross-border spillovers” and thus that domestic action must be conducted in a cooperative fashion.

"TheSustainable Development Goals Report 2020finds that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world had been making progress in several areas, including maternal and child health and access to electricity. Nonetheless, growing food insecurity, deterioration of the natural environment, and persistent inequalities remain and have been exacerbated by the pandemic.On the issues of poverty, healthcare, and education, the 2020 edition of this annual report documents:the first rise in global poverty since 1998, with an estimated 71 million people expected to be pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020;the disruptions to health and vaccination services and limited access to diet and nutrition services could cause hundreds of thousands of additional under-5 deaths and tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths in 2020; andschool closures have kept 90% of students worldwide out of school.This report was launched at the opening of the 2020 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2020), on 7 July. The report uses data as of June 2020 for selected indicators in the global indicator framework for the SDGs, as developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 July 2017.TheSustainable Development Goals Report 2020is the third of three global assessments on SDG progress that are released in preparation for the annual HLPF session. The yearly report of the UN Secretary-General on progress towards the 17 SDGs (SDG Progress Report) is released several months before the HLPF. The 2020 edition reported that progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) annually releases a Sustainable Development Goals Report along with indexes that list countries by SDG achievement. Their 2020 edition focuses on ‘The Sustainable Development Goals and Covid-19.’ The report indicates that all regions have made progress in the SDG index since 2015, with East and South Asia having progressed the most.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In their meeting on 27 January 2020, the Principals of the member organizations of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF) endorsed a ‘Strategic Vision towards 2030.’ Also in January, religious leaders met in Indonesia to launch the country’sInterfaith Rainforest Initiativecountry programme. Both endeavors support achievement of globally agreed goals on forests within the context of the forthcoming UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration in 2021.The CPFStrategic Visioncalls for the sustainable management of all types of forests and forest landscapes by 2030. It seeks to recognize the multiple values of forests, unlock their goods and services, and it calls for the achievement of the SDGs and the Global Forest Goals. To support countries in the achievement of these aims, the CPF will enhance coherence and synergy on forest-related issues and values among its member organizations. It will focus on moving from deforestation to restoration.The CPF will also work towards a set of strategic priorities that include: supporting the achievement of the globally-agreed goals and targets on forests; promoting the science-policy interface and science-based decision making; enhancing communication and outreach activities; enhancing cross-sectoral collaboration, policy coherence, coordination, and integrated approaches; unlocking the full potential and values of forests; and identifying emerging issues of significant concern to forests. The CPF will operationalize these priorities through its 4-year workplans, which  align with the quadrennial workplans of the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF).The Decade is expected to upscale the restoration of degraded ecosystems and support efforts to address the climate and biodiversity crises.Speaking on the Vision, Hiroto Mitsugi, FAO Assistant Director-General and Chair of the CPF said it was “crucial to move from deforestation to restoration.” He also noted that “in light of the upcoming UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the CPF has an increasingly important role to play.” The Decade, which will conclude in 2030, is expected to upscale the restoration of degraded ecosystems and support efforts to address the climate and biodiversity crises while enhancing food and water security, among other ecosystem services.Also in January, religious leaders met in Jakarta, Indonesia to launch theInterfaith Rainforest Initiativecountry programme. The leadersrecognizedthe “destruction and loss of tropical forests as a threat to the sustainability of human life,” and they demanded immediate and decisive action to protect the country’s forests. The Interfaith Rainforest Initiative in Indonesia will be carried forward by an Advisory Council, representing a coalition between religious communities, indigenous peoples, civil society, the scientific community and the UN.

"The benefits of establishing a joint agenda between local, national, and international levels to bolster local action and accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, post-COVID-19, were the focus of a side event that took place on the sidelines of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).The event, ‘Accelerating Transformation from the Ground-up in a Post-COVID Era,’ took place as part of Local and Regional Governments Day and was organized by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).During the event, local and regional government representatives highlighted the need for investments that support universal access to essential public services, green recovery, and revamped multilateralism to achieve the SDGs in the post-COVID-19 era. Participants discussed thelocal and regional government constituency’s Joint Statement to the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)and defined priorities for the post-COVID-19 period.The event also marked the launch of a UCLG report,Towards the Localization of the SDGs. Marina Ponti, Director, UN SDG Action Campaign, announced the September launch, with UCLG, of a global mobilization campaign for local and regional actors on the occasion of the UN’s 75th anniversary.Speakers highlighted the importance of,inter alia: the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change in guiding all recovery efforts; multilateralism and the need for collaboration across all levels of government and stakeholders; and knowledge sharing among local and regional governments and collaboration with international institutions during the post-COVID-19 rebuilding process.On challenges exacerbated by COVID-19, participants mentioned: revenue generation as a growing problem for local and regional governments; difficulties faced by local and regional governments in developing countries in localizing the SDGs, given high poverty and illiteracy rates; and a lack of policy coherence and coordination between local and regional governments and different levels of government as a barrier to effective management of the pandemic.Participants also cautioned that the COVID-19 crisis has deepened gender inequality. They called for establishing gender violence protection programmes, and inclusion of gender considerations in local budgeting when rethinking cities.Local and regional government representatives also observed:the increased demand for digital transformation at the local and regional levels as a result of the pandemic;digitization must be inclusive and not lead to increased inequalities;the pandemic revealed the necessity of decentralizing governance; andthe need for reconstructing the international system with local governments at the forefront of sustainable development and SDG implementation.On rebuilding societies and economies post-COVID-19, Almudena Maillo, Councilor of Madrid, Spain, said the Local and Regional Government Joint Statement to the HLPF should further the economic recovery of cities and prioritize the economic SDGs, namely SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).This event took place on 10 July 2020 in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"9 July 2019: UN officials informed participants at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) that a survey is being conducted to collect their views on the first four years of the HLPF. The results of the survey will be presented on 18 July 2019, during a “town hall” meeting on the future of the HLPF.At the opening of the HLPF session on 9 July 2019, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), announced that DESA is conducting the survey to help take stock of how the HLPF and its voluntary national review (VNR) mechanism have worked in the first four-year cycle. He said the results will provide inputs to the intergovernmental review of the HLPF that will take place during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) (2019-2020).Views are being collected from representatives of UN Member States, the UN system, and the Major Groups and other stakeholders. It is available in the six official UN languages.They survey queries respondents’ level of agreement with several statements, including that:The HLPF has brought together participants from all walks of life, working in all three dimensions of sustainable development;HLPF discussions have been sufficiently well-prepared and based on evidence, data and analysis;The HLPF has sufficiently discussed interlinkages among the SDGs;The HLPF should continue to review a set of SDGs every year;The engagement of Major Groups and other stakeholders has been meaningful at the HLPF;The VNRs have been useful for advancing national implementation;The HLPF should include reviews by business, cities or other actors; andParticipants have taken good examples for SDG implementation back to their countries.It also asks what elements should be included in the Ministerial Declaration resulting from each annual HLPF session.According to theHLPF programme, Liu will share the results of the survey during a “town hall” session on Thursday, 18 July 2019. The first part of the meeting will focus on lessons learned from the HLPF’s first cycle, featuring the assessments of experts, stakeholders and officials. In the second part, Liu will present the results of the DESA survey, and representatives from Liechtenstein and Colombia – who are serving as rapporteurs for the ECOSOC President on this topic – will present the main messages of the HLPF as input to Heads of State and Government attending the SDG Summit in September 2019.The HLPF is under way at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from 9-18 July 2019.

"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published a brochure presenting the benefits of the sound management of chemicals for governments, industry, and the general public. The publication also highlights linkages with specific SDG targets and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) on chemicals.The brochure titled, ‘Benefits from Implementing a Chemical Management System,’ focuses on benefits related to: the management of industrial chemicals; agricultural pesticides; chemical accidents prevention, preparedness and response; and the establishment of the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs).The brochure describes the ways in which sound chemicals management contributes to achieving specific SDG targets, namely:Target 3.9 on reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination;Target 6.3 on improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials;Target 9.4 on making infrastructure and industries sustainable;Target 11.6 on reducing cities’ environmental impacts; andTarget 12.4 on achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes.In addition, the brochure points to progress and challenges related to the tracking of SDGs with PRTRs. It mentions that the OECD is exploring how PRTR data can be used to undertake analyses, and evaluate and potentially accelerate progress towards meeting relevant SDG targets.Sound chemicals management also helps implement various chemicals-related MEAs, which were adopted between 1985 and 2013, including: the Minamata Convention on Mercury; the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs); the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (PIC); the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer; and the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.Sound management also helps implement the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), which was established in 2006, and is currently under negotiation for the period beyond 2020. [Publication:Brochure on the Benefits from Implementing a Chemical Management System]",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has published an information note that outlines how COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, produced, and deployed around the world. The note describes the vaccine value chain, and identifies intersections with governments’ trade policies and WTO rules.The note titled, ‘Developing and Delivering COVID-19 Vaccines Around the World,’ highlights national and global targets that have been set as part of an ambitious COVID-19 response and vaccination plan. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, two billion COVID-19 vaccine doses are targeted for distribution by the end of 2021. An August 2020 survey by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) estimates that there is capacity to produce up to 4 billion doses this year. However, the note flags that vaccine shortages occur regularly, and that 69 countries reported vaccine “stockouts” (shortages lasting at least one month in duration) for yellow fever, measles, and polio in 2018.Successful immunization programmes needed to rein in the pandemic are “built on functional, end-to-end supply chain and logistics systems,” the note emphasizes. The WTO provides a visual, non-exhaustive seven-step overview of the vaccine development and delivery process. The infographic, aimed at policymakers to ensure that government efforts on COVID-19 result in prompt vaccine distribution, underscores that quality assurance is a continuous effort, and is necessary across all seven steps, which span:Vaccine development;Domestic approval (manufacture);Vaccine manufacture;Domestic approval (importer);International distribution;Border clearance; andDomestic distribution and surveillance.Identifying the role trade policy can play in ensuring the rapid roll-out of vaccines against COVID-19, the information note expands on the checklist with additional issues and questions for consideration as part of each step. On the first (vaccine development), the note flags the need for policies that promote effective, timely cross-border exchange of scientific information, data, and physical samples, as well as the need for domestic laws to facilitate international research and development collaboration.On a vaccine’s physical international distribution and border clearance (steps 5 and 6), the note asks policymakers to consider what measures their governments can take to support airlines’ expanded cargo capacity, ensure that export restrictions do not hinder access to raw materials and components, and that COVID-19-related goods are prioritized for clearance, with simplified or expedited arrival procedures. Likewise, the note asks readers to consider what measures border agencies can take to ensure cold chain integrity as several vaccines need to be kept in sub-freezing temperatures in order to remain viable and effective.For each step, the note provides links to supplemental WTO resources and additional literature.

"At the 21st Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (the Barcelona Convention) and its Protocols (COP 21), governments adopted the Naples Ministerial Declaration, committing to, inter alia, address marine litter, strengthen and expand the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) network, respond to climate change, and support the blue economy and a regional ecological transition.The Barcelona Convention COP 21 took place from 2-5 December 2019, at the Castel dell’Ovo in Naples, Italy. Over 200 participants from the 22 Contracting Parties as well as representatives from UN agencies, international research organizations, multilateral development banks, the private sector, and civil society attended the four-day event.Through the Naples Ministerial Declaration, Parties also committed to develop trans-disciplinary research and inter-sectoral policies to address climate change through a cross-cutting approach, particularly with regard to the water-food-energy nexus.Aside of the Ministerial Declaration, some of the thematic decisions adopted at COP 21 included:the common regional framework for integrated coastal zone management;Mediterranean offshore guidelines and standards;updated guidelines regulating the placement of artificial reefs at sea;governance;identification and conservation of sites of particular ecological interest in the Mediterranean; anda road map for the possible designation of the Mediterranean Sea area as an emission control area for sulphur oxides pursuant to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, annex VI, within the framework of the Barcelona Convention.During a ministerial session, Joyce Msuya, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), remarked that a recently concluded study found that there are about 62 million individual pieces of marine litter floating in the Mediterranean Sea, adding that progress on improving the marine environment in the Mediterranean region can serve as a powerful driving force towards achieving the SDGs.In a video message, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, echoed the need to address the “plastic plague,” explaining that plastic has permeated the food chain to the point where we are “eating the consequences.” Gaetano Leone, UNEP, noted that the Barcelona Convention must be central to the events taking place during 2020, as the “super year” for the global development and biodiversity agendas.In a High-Level Panel Discussion on Protecting the Marine Environment and Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, Gavin Edwards, Global Coordinator, World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), called out the challenge of moving MPAs from ‘paper parks’ to areas of enforcement. He reiterated that 2020 will be a “super year” of opportunity for the planet given the second UN Ocean Conference and the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, adding that many sectors, including business and finance, are increasingly taking biodiversity and climate protection “more seriously.”During the high-level discussion, delegates further highlighted the need to,inter alia: not scare people about the current climate situation but instead instill optimism; not underestimate the climate challenge; and to scale up efforts and restore science and evidence-based policies to increase confidence.The Barcelona Convention COP 22 will take place in Turkey in December 2021.

"The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, have announced the Global Tourism Plastics Initiative. To promote a shift towards circularity, the initiative calls on all tourism companies and destinations to take concrete actions to tackle plastic pollution and increase plastics recycling.The Global Tourism Plastics initiative aims to reduce plastic pollution from the tourism sector through a set of actionable commitments by 2025. The Initiative will work to eliminate unnecessary or problematic plastic packaging and support the shift from single-use plastic towards reusable alternatives or models by 2025. The Initiative will also engage the value chain to promote 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable and commit to collaborate and invest in increasing the recycling and composting rate for plastics.The Initiative is an activity of the One Planet Network’s Sustainable Tourism Programme, a multi-stakeholder partnership to implement SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The Initiative acts as the interface between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and the tourism sector. The New Plastics Economy Global Manager, Gerald Naber, said the initiative will unite the tourism sector behind a “vision for a world in which plastic never becomes waste or pollution.” He emphasized that concerted action can help eliminate unneeded plastics and drive innovation to ensure that needed plastics “can be safely and easily circulated—keeping them in the economy and out of the environment.”UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili welcomed the Initiative as an opportunity for tourism companies and destinations “to step forward and lead the global effort addressing plastic pollution.” He encouraged Initiative participants to set quantifiable targets and help accelerate the tourism sector’s transformation towards more integrated solutions and circular business models.The Initiative will report annually on progress made towards its targets.

"13 September: A new briefing note by the Global Mechanism (GM) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) explores the interlinkages between land degradation, poverty and inequality. The publication argues that investing in land degradation neutrality (LDN), and thus achieving the SDG target 15.3, will help end poverty (SDG 1) and reduce inequality (SDG 10).The ‘Land Degradation, Poverty, and Inequality’ briefing note was developed by the GM in collaboration with Conservation International and the German Development Institute. Using evidence from more than 800 sub-national regions, the document demonstrates that land degradation generates or reinforces poverty and inequality by disproportionally impacting populations largely dependent on land resources for their livelihoods. The research finds that the places with the highest proportion of degraded land are also home to the most disadvantaged people of society in terms of poverty and inequality: 80% of the extreme poor live in rural areas and 65% work in the agricultural sector.The research finds that 80% of the extreme poor live in rural areas and 65% work in the agricultural sector.The text cites the ‘World Atlas of Desertification,‘ according to which approximately 20% of the earth’s vegetated land surface showed persistent declining trends in land productivity between the years 1999 and 2013. The briefing note also highlights theTrends.Earth toolreport that cites a global degradation of 15% between the years 2001 and 2015.The publication recommends:Investing in LDN as an accelerator to achieve SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), particularly in rural areas where 80% of the poor live;Directing investments associated with the achievement of LDN towards regions characterized by both high land restoration potential and poor socioeconomic conditions;Taking advantage of the synergies resulting from national and international development agendas, such as LDN targets and measures, Nationally Determined Contributions, the Bonn Challenge, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and the New York Declaration on Forests; andIncreasing domestic public expenditure on protecting terrestrial ecosystems to tackle the most pressing social and economic challenges facing countries today, by contributing to the creation of jobs, alleviating poverty and reducing inequality.The GM released the briefing note in parallel to the 14th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD.

"The Government of Mexico has published a report that quantifies co-benefits from implementing the climate agenda in coordination with the sustainable development agenda in the country.The report titled, ‘Crunching Numbers: Quantifying the Sustainable Development Co-benefits of Mexico’s Climate Commitments,’ measures priority co-benefits resulting from implementing current and potential commitments in Mexico’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the UNFCCC, arguing that climate action and development policies should be harmonized and integrated because they reinforce each other and achieve more together.The report quantifies social, economic and environmental co-benefits of climate action in various sectors and their impact for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It argues that climate action is a “lever” that enables achievement of the SDGs, and explains that the relationship between sustainable development and climate change goes beyond SDG 13 (climate action).The study identifies six co-benefits resulting from implementing three current and two potential NDC commitments and their contribution to the SDGs. The NDC commitments analyzed are:achieving 43% of electricity generation from clean sources by 2030 (existing NDC);achieving a net-zero deforestation rate by 2030 (existing NDC);guaranteeing and monitoring the treatment of urban and industrial wastewater in human settlements larger than 500,000 inhabitants (existing NDC);achieving 500,000 electric vehicle sales in Mexico by 2030 (potential NDC); andreducing energy demand in the three most energy-intensive industrial sectors, namely cement (by 1.8%), chemicals (by 9.6%) and iron and steel (by 14.7%) by 2030 (potential NDC).According to the report, implementation of these commitments could result in the following co-benefits: improving livelihoods and community resilience; improved public health; increased food security; improved conditions of water resources; employment creation; and contributing to energy security.As an example, the report explains that achieving Mexico’s electricity generation NDC goal can catalyze social development through improvements in public health, which can contribute to SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and save USD 2.7 billion between 2019-2030 of funds usually spent to treat air pollution-related diseases.Understanding and measuring such co-benefits, the report notes, helps identify opportunities to accelerate progress in both agendas, by guiding decision making, avoiding duplication of efforts and reducing implementation costs. Mexico, according to the report, has the institutional capacity to achieve both the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda if mitigation and adaptation are mainstreamed into development planning.The report was commissioned by the Mexican Office of the Presidency, with support from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

Early data for 41 countries show that trade in medical goods grew by 38.7% in the first half of 2020. The WTO has also updated its services trade barometer with data through the second quarter of 2020, which shows gains in some sectors.The WTO information note identifies a variety of positive actions and findings, flagging that shortages of personal protective equipment have eased since the early stages of the pandemic. Commitments and statements bytrade ministersandG20 leadersfrom early in the pandemic, the WTO highlights, have helped keep markets open and medical goods trade flowing.Transparency, the information note underscores, is “a key building block of the commitment to keeping markets open.” A WTO news release notes that many of these actions are a matter of public record, as a result of countries’ formal notifications to the WTO, the organization’s trade monitoring report or its COVID-19 monitoring exercise. Of the measures reported to the WTO, those that reduce or eliminate import tariffs comprise about two-thirds of the trade facilitation actions taken by countries.To ensure goods’ smooth movement across borders, the WTO points to actions taken by countries to update customs procedures such that red tape is cut, documentation requirements are eased, and electronic processing helps streamline the import and export of medical supplies. Likewise, the information note acknowledges the temporary removal or deferral of duties, taxes, and other charges by 40 WTO members on COVID-19-critical medical goods and other essential items. The note applauds countries that have not only deferred taxes or tariffs on medical supplies, but also related goods or services that ensure their delivery (e.g. transport equipment).On measures taken to improve access to COVID-19-related medical services, the note highlights countries’ facilitating the international movement of health workers (e.g. through work permit and visa extensions) and actions to increase the utilization of telemedicine by overcoming regulatory hurdles. Each of these services, the document emphasizes, serve to alleviate pressure on national health systems and enable medical care on short notice, and allow for the transmission of health-related information to remote locations.In spite of certain gains, the WTO’s services trade barometer’s overall score “of 95.6 is the weakest on record for the index,” where a score of 100 represents the baseline for medium-term trends.The services trade barometer generates a composite score based on six component indices. The score is heavily affected by the collapse of passenger air transport – one of the six indices measured – in 2020 due to COVID-19. The remaining five indices appear to be stabilizing. The WTO releases two trade barometers, on goods trade and on services trade.

"18 July 2019: The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conducted a global survey of countries to identify existing laws on the right to information, and how they are observed. The researchers found that 125 countries have enacted right to information laws (RTI) or similar provisions.UNESCOlaunchedthe report titled, ‘Powering Sustainable Development with Access to Information: Highlights from the 2019 UNESCO Monitoring and Reporting of SDG Indicator 16.10.2,’ during the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in New York.Guy Berger, UNESCO, cited a recommendation from the study that governments better oversee the implementation of RTI laws. He said they could do so by connecting oversight bodies such as Information Commissions with national-level SDG monitoring bodies. The publication notes that, while national regulation systems increasingly support freedom of information, oversight and appeals bodies and individual public authorities could do “far better” in tracking and processing information requests and appeals.The survey data contributes to global monitoring of SDG target 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements. In the UN system, UNESCO is the custodian agency for SDG indicator 16.10.2 on the number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information. Its work on monitoring and reporting of access to information is conducted through itsInternational Programme for the Development of Communication, supported by Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

"16 July 2019:Two new knowledge platforms have been launched to provide the financial and private sectors with the latest research, data, guidance and tools to help green their operations and fulfill the need for practical and targeted knowledge to support the transition to inclusive green economies.The platforms are a joint initiative of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the World Bank, under the auspices of the Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP).SMEs’ involvement in transitioning to an inclusive green economy is critical to achieving the SDGs.TheGreen Industry Platformand theGreen Finance Platformwere announced on 16 July 2019 on the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF) in New York, US. The platforms will build on theGGKP, which provides know-how to support national-level green policymaking.The Green Industry Platform is a user-friendly online database of information, tools and practical guidance to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to become more efficient, competitive and sustainable by going green. It will provide SMEs with technical knowledge to green their input materials, end products and operations, and with the evidence that “greening” their companies will improve their bottom lines.Welcoming the launch of the platforms, Li Yong, Director General, UNIDO, explained that since SMEs employ up to 60% of the global workforce, their involvement in transitioning to an inclusive green economy is critical to achieving the SDGs.The Green Finance Platform will provide banks, insurance and investment firms with a “one-stop shop” for the latest financial sector innovations to start, scale and measure their contributions to a green economic transition. It will include: tools for businesses and investors to assess natural capital risks and opportunities; guidance on responsible banking, insurance and finance; and global reports on aligning the financial system with sustainable development.

"The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) has released the findings of a 2018 monitoring study, reporting “mixed progress” in the quality of development partnerships. The study finds that countries are increasingly using the SDGs as a shared results framework, but the enabling environment for civil society has generally declined.While national governments have made “significant progress” in strengthening national development planning, the report finds, donor countries are giving less directly to partner countries’ budgets, which means that there is limited parliamentary oversight of funds received by developing countries.Other findings and recommendations from the 166-page report are:Multilateral development banks (MDBs) have increased their reliance on country-owned results frameworks, but bilateral donors in general have become less aligned to the priorities expressed by partner countries;There are insufficient government data available, and national statistics systems need to be strengthened;Public financial management systems, including procurement systems, have been strengthened, but donors are not always using them;Government engagement with civil society could be more regular and could involve more diverse stakeholders;Civil society organizations (CSOs) report that there are fewer protections for CSOs working with at-risk populations and exercising freedom of expression;All actors are experiencing limited capacity to engage in public-private dialogue, although this is still seen as useful; andThere is room for improvement in making official data available on development co-operation.In the course of this study, GPEDC leaders – the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) – drew on data collected by 86 partnership countries and territories, in collaboration with more than 100 development partners. Data collected during the GPEDC study relate to SDG targets on respecting each country’s policy space and leadership on poverty eradication and sustainable development (SDG target 17.15), enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships (SDG target 17.16), and adopting and strengthening policies and legislation for gender equality and women’s empowerment (SDG target 5.C).GPEDC was established by the 2011 Busan Partnership agreement to promote effective partnerships between developing countries and donors. It monitors progress biennially, based on four internationally agreed principles for development partnerships: country ownership; focus on results; inclusive partnerships; and transparency and mutual accountability.

"16 August 2019: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Human Rights Office signed a cooperation agreement on protecting environmental and human rights. The agreement responds to the growing threats to individuals and communities defending their environmental and land rights in many parts of the world.While seeking to increase support for national implementation of human rights-based environmental policies, the partnership aims to also promote global recognition and acceptance of the human right to a healthy environment.The strengthened cooperation between UNEP and the UN Human Rights Office will better protections for environmental human rights defenders and their families, who often face violence, including killings and sexual violence, smear campaigns, and other forms of intimidation. The two agencies will monitor threats against environmental rights defenders; advocate for better protection; urge more effective accountability for perpetrators of violence and intimidation; develop networks of environmental human rights defenders; and promote meaningful and informed participation by rights defenders and civil society in environmental decision-making. The partnership will also increase support to national governments to promote human rights-based policies, especially in the sustainable management of natural resources, development planning, and actions to combat climate change.Failing to protect biodiversity will also negatively impact the human rights to food and safe drinking water, and the rights of indigenous peoples.On the occasion of the agreement’s launch, UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen underscored the need to curtail the use of anti-protest and anti-terrorism laws to criminalize the use of rights that should be constitutionally protected, adding that UNEP and the UN Human Rights Office are committed to assist state and non-state actors to promote, protect, and respect environmental and human rights.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet added that every state needs to be encouraged to develop and enforce national legal frameworks that uphold “the clear linkages between a healthy environment and the ability to enjoy all other human rights, including the rights to health, water, food, and even the right to life.”Prior to this cooperation agreement, in June 2019, in a statement following the release of the latest global biodiversity assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a group of UN experts underscored that failing to protect biodiversity can be a human rights violation, as it can constitute a violation of the right to a healthy environment, a right legally recognized by 155 States. The experts explained that failing to protect biodiversity will also negatively impact the human rights to food and safe drinking water, and the rights of indigenous peoples.

"30 September 2019: Businesses, world leaders, communities, youth activists and other stakeholders came together in New York, US, for Climate Week NYC 2019 to discuss, catalyze and demand greater climate action. More than 350 events took place throughout the Week in 11 categories.Hosted by The Climate Group, an international non-profit organization, and organized in partnership with the UN and the City of New York, the Week’s 2019 edition convened events on: 1) Youth and Climate Activism; 2) Energy Transition; 3) Industry Transition; 4) Clean Transport, Buildings and Infrastructure; 5) Food, Land and Nature-based Solutions; 6) Climate Finance, Investment and Carbon Pricing; 7) National Government Policy and Commitment; 8) State, City and Local Action; 9) Health, Equality and Justice; 10) Sustainable Travel and Leisure; and 11) Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Change.During the opening ceremony on 23 September, Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, President of Spain, highlighted the urgent need to accelerate climate action, and announced his country’s commitment to phasing out fossil fuels by 2050 and reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2030. Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister of Denmark, discussed Denmark’s goal to reduce emissions by 70% by 2030. Alvarado Quesada, President of Costa Rica, underscored that business needs to be part of climate action.Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington State, US, and North American Co-Chair of Under2 Coalition, highlighted climate action by US federal states. “States are just as powerful as federal government to act against climate change. In fact, states are leading the charge,” he said.‘The Hub,’ which was held from 24-25 September, gathered businesses, states, cities and other climate actors to “showcase how they are shaping the future economy through climate-forward initiatives and innovative solutions.”Climate Week NYC 2019 took place on the side of theopeningof the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 74).

"13 August 2019: The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) released a report that finds forest vertebrate populations declined by 53% on average between 1970 and 2014. The report warns this decline has “serious consequences for forest integrity and climate change.”The report titled, ‘Below the Canopy: Plotting Global Trends in Forest Wildlife Populations,’ provides evidence to inform discussions and negotiations around a ‘New Deal for Nature and People’, arguing that biodiversity below the forest canopy is a critical, yet often under-appreciated, component of healthy functioning forest ecosystems. The report also aims to support synergies among the post-2020 biodiversity framework, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.The report finds that deforestation and habitat loss are a major driver in the loss of forest species, accounting for approximately 60% of the threats to forest specialists. Other drivers of species loss include climate change, invasive species, over-exploitation and disease. Declines were highest in tropical forest areas, including the Amazon rainforest. To restore forest biodiversity, the report recommends tackling deforestation and increasing forest cover while also addressing the multiple pressures faced by forest species.The report recommends that the post-2020 global biodiversity framework include a direct measure of forest biodiversity.The report cautions, however, that “changes in tree cover do not always reflect changes in the populations of animals below the canopy.” Consequently, the report argues that forest cover is not an appropriate proxy for measuring global forest biodiversity. The report therefore recommends the post-2020 global biodiversity framework include a direct measure of forest biodiversity as well as forest quality, quantity and cover. The report proposes the Forest Specialist Index as a tool to track the status of forest vertebrate populations and to provide an improved measure of forest ecosystem health. To inform conservation strategies, the report calls for greater investment in long-term, systematic forest biodiversity monitoring.The report highlights success stories where forest specialist populations have recovered. In Costa Rica, the establishment of Santa Rosa National Park in 1971 helped protect the forest areas from hunting, logging and other human disturbances, contributing to forest regeneration. As the forests began to recover, the area’s monkey populations also increased. Other success stories, such as the recovery of the mountain gorilla, aim to illustrate how the right strategies, such as combining habitat restoration with community engagement in anti-poaching strategies, can help support the recovery of forest vertebrate populations.

"The European Union (EU) has stressed the urgency of the “climate emergency and the consequences of mass biodiversity loss” in a resolution in advance of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The resolution “calls on the Commission and the Council to set a clear spending target for biodiversity mainstreaming of at least 10% in its Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-2027, in addition to the target for spending on climate mainstreaming.”In theresolution of 16 Januarythe EU Parliament calls for increased ambition in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which the CBD COP 15 is expected to adopt in October. The resolution calls for Europe to lead by example to address global biodiversity loss, noting with concern the findings of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which “underlines the magnitude of the ecological crisis and the need for urgent and concerted efforts fostering transformation change” to tackle biodiversity loss and halt species extinctions. EU Parliamentarians also express deep concern on the impact of climate change in driving biodiversity loss, concluding the world is “facing an environmental emergency, which requires significant action.” They stress that COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.The EU Parliament identifies the upcoming EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 as an opportunity to demonstrate European leadership on biodiversity. Parliamentarians support taking biodiversity objectives into account in all EU policies and earmarking a minimum of 10% of the EU’s 2021-2027 long-term budget towards efforts to improve biodiversity. Parliamentarians further call for ensuring that natural areas make up at least 30% of the EU territory; restoring degraded ecosystems by 2030, by restoring natural forests, peatlands, floodplains, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal zones and marine areas; and promoting more sustainable agricultural and forestry practices, including binding reduction targets on pesticide use in the EU. They also call on the European Commission (EC) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to include biodiversity-proofing components in their financial instruments to avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity.The resolution coincides with other steps the European Commission is taking towards implementing a European Green Deal. In her keynote speech to the World Economic Forum, the President of the European Commission Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen said that the European Union will mobilize EUR 1 trillion of investment that will “create a green investment wave.” [EU Press Release on EU COP 15 Position] [European Parliament Resolution] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Green New Deal] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on EC Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on IPBES Assessment] [Keynote European Commission President Speech]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"23 September 2019: At the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, a coalition of donors, aid institutions and philanthropies pledged more than USD 790 million to help 300 million smallholder farmers in developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. The commitment, of which USD 765 million will be delivered through the CGIAR System Organization, follows a recently released flagship report from the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA), which calls for global leadership to accelerate adaptation.The announcement came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the UK, the Netherlands, the European Commission, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany.TheGCA report, issued ahead of the Summit, presented a detailed action plan for tackling climate threats to agriculture and food security, and a recommendation to double the scale of agricultural research through the CGIAR System. The publication found that investing in adaptation can yield robust economic, environmental and social benefits. The commitments are part of GCA’s Action Track to advance adaptation for agriculture and food security.Bill Gates, Co-chair, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, explained that his foundation’s USD 310 million pledge represents a “down payment” aimed at supporting the goal of doubling the funding for CGIAR research to “fully equip” the organization to respond to farmers’ climate challenges.Specifically, the financial resources will support the CGIAR in developing innovations that will help smallholder farmers improve their livelihoods and build resilience in the face of climate change.The CGIAR hosts the world’s largest network of crop breeders focused exclusively on the needs of poor farmers. The organization is pioneering the development of a new generation of food crops that can endure drought, floods, higher temperatures and soils tainted with salt from rising seas. CGIAR’s 15 Research Centers are also working as a single unit under its flagship Two Degree Initiative for Food and Agriculture. The Two Degree Initiative is helping small-scale food producers adapt their farming systems, livelihoods and landscapes to weather extremes and embrace production practices that lower emissions.Additional initiatives under GCA’s Agriculture and Food Security track include:expanding access to climate-related digital advisory services for at least 100 million small-scale producers by 2030;scaling up access for at least 100 million small-scale producers to reach insurance, markets, finance and productive safety nets; andimproving access to and use of adaptation technologies and agroecological practices for 100 million small-scale producers.[CGIAR Press Release] [ICARDA Press Release] [World Resources Institute Press Release] [CGIAR Website] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Climate Action Summit]",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

"The year 2020 marks the 35th anniversary of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.The Vienna Convention is a framework agreement adopted in 1985, setting out principles for cooperation and information sharing on the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Convention Secretariatreportsthat it was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, and it reached universal ratification in 2009.In a message on 16 September 2020, the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Convention was the first step in fixing the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. He highlighted that few global agreements have been as successful as this one has been. The Convention’sMontreal Protocolhas facilitated phasing out the gases that caused the ozone hole, which were used in aerosols and cooling appliances. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 values by mid-century.The next step, the Secretary-General said, is to find new alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances, since replacements themselves are now known to contribute to global warming. This is the focus of the Montreal Protocol’s most recent agreement, the Kigali Amendment, whichcame into forcein January 2019. Itcalls forreducing the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.In her message on the International Day, UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson said that if fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment will prevent 0.4°C of global warming. [Message of UN Secretary-General] [Message of UNEP Executive Director]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"24 September 2019: At a meeting in Isapra, Italy, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission held the second global workshop of the World Water Quality Alliance (WWQA).The Alliance, comprised of approximately 50 organizations, is meant to provide evidence-based assessment, solutions and services addressing water quality issues. This data will be used to produce a baseline assessment of global water quality and its drivers as called for by the third meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-3). The assessment is to be considered byUNEA-5, which will convene in 2021, in Nairobi, Kenya.UNEP estimates that 80% of wastewater globally is released directly into water bodies without treatment, and that by 2050, the world could see at least a doubling of wastewater production. In response,inter alia, the UNEA-3 resolution (UNEP/EA.3/Res.10) calls for better data collection, water monitoring and technologies to recycle and reuse wastewater. The resolution also tasks UNEP, in cooperation with other organizations in and beyond UN-Water, to develop a global water quality assessment, taking into account, among others, emerging pollutants.Speaking on the WWQA, UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen noted how “improving water quality is central to environmental sustainability and to ensuring healthy ecosystems, healthy people and a healthy planet.”UNEP is the custodian agency for data collection for indicators under targets 6.3, 6.5 and 6.6.

"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) released a report on the status of drylands around the world. It finds that drylands are home to more than one-third of the world’s global biodiversity hotspots and half the world’s livestock and provide critical migration points for birds. FAO launched the report at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP25) to the UNFCCC.The publication titled, ‘Trees, forests and land use in drylands: The first global assessment,’ finds that drylands cover 6.1 billion hectares, or 41% of the Earth’s land surface. Globally, 18% of dryland areas consist of forest, with almost half of these areas featuring canopy density above 70%. The least arid areas contain the most forest: 52% of dryland forest is in the dry subhumid zone and 41% in the semi-arid zone compared to 7% in the arid zone and less than 1% in the hyperarid zone. Trees also grow on drylands outside of forests, particularly in Asia and Europe. The report provides the baseline for future monitoring of drylands and aims to help countries in the sustainable management of these areas.Though dryland ecosystems are vulnerable to drought, desertification, degradation, and climate impacts, they are home to an estimated two billion people.Though dryland ecosystems are vulnerable to drought, desertification, land degradation, climate impacts and water shortages, they are home to an estimated two billion people. Drylands are predicted to expand by 10 to 23 percent by the end of the 21st century, with dangerous implications for food security, human welfare and livelihoods. Trees and forests in drylands can help mitigate these challenges by providing environmental services, including the prevention of erosion and desertification, regulation of water and soil fertility, and habitat for biodiversity.The report highlights the importance of understanding the status and changes in dryland areas in identifying strategies to tackle land degradation and desertification, conserve biodiversity, and increase the resilience of landscapes and communities. The report also provides a benchmark for measuring progress towards land degradation neutrality targets. The publication further emphasizes the role of drylands as “productive landscapes with considerable economic potential and environmental value.” The report calls for investing in forest and woodland resources in these areas, including trees outside forests.FAO’s Committee on Forestry (COFO) requested FAO to undertake a global assessment of the status and extent of drylands in 2014 with the aim of better prioritizing and targeting investments for dryland restoration and management. The report is a response to COFO’s request.FAO also released an issue of its magazine ‘Unasylva’ that examines the role of forests as nature-based solutions for water management. The issue highlights that forested watersheds provide approximately 75% of global accessible freshwater resources, underscoring the critical role of forests in providing natural infrastructure for high-quality water for over 50% of the world’s population. The issue emphasizes the increasing importance of water resources management in the context of climate change.

"17 September 2019: The Presidents of the 73rd and 74th sessions of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General each identified climate change as a key global challenge in their remarks at the closing of UNGA 73 and the opening of UNGA 74. They all highlighted the role of the Assembly in tackling global challenges.UNGA 73 President María Espinosa Garcés (Ecuador) stressed the UN’s establishment to “confront the major challenges facing humanity” in her outgoing remarks. She identified climate change, inequality and terrorism as major challenges alongside long-standing challenges, such as poverty, hunger and war. Garcés said the UNGA is the ideal forum to reach agreements and make progress towards global solutions to these challenges.Garcés recalled her Presidency’s priorities, particularly the strengthening of women in the UNGA’s activities. She further highlighted,inter alia: eradication of single-use plastics at UN Headquarters; support for the Global Compact on Migration; the need for decent work for all in the context of the International Labour Organization (ILO) centennial; inclusion of youth; and synergies across the Organization. Garcés expressed hope that UNGA 74 defends multilateralism to “deliver tangible results to people’s lives.”The UNGA is a universal platform to build consensus for the common good.UN Secretary-General António Guterres stressed that “global challenges require global solutions” at the closing session of UNGA 73. He identified key challenges such as climate change, inequality and migration, as well as the need to tackle intolerance and harness technology for good. He described the UNGA as a “universal platform to build consensus for the common good.” Guterres concluded his remarks by thanking Garcés for her work as “a champion of multilateralism”; her commitment to the environment, especially ending plastic pollution; and her role in increasing the participation of women in the political sphere and accelerating gender equality.In his opening remarks, UNGA 74 President, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande (Nigeria), highlighted the UNGA’s role in eradicating poverty, combating climate change and empowering vulnerable people. He outlined his priorities for UNGA 74, including: climate change; access to free, high quality primary and secondary education; the empowerment of youth, women and other vulnerable groups; and effective conflict mediation and early settlement of disputes. Muhammad-Bande highlighted the UNGA’s role in building “trust and empathy among Member States” to address global challenges.Speakers praised UNGA 73’s adoption of several key agreements, including two Global Compacts on Migration and Refugees, and progress on UN reform. Speakers also looked forward to upcoming events during UNGA 74, including the annual UNGA High-level Debate and five summits on climate action, the SDGs, financing for development (FfD), universal health care (UHC) and small island developing States (SIDS). UN Secretary-General Guterres identified 2020 as a critical year for action on the SDGs and building “urgent ambition on climate change,” convincing people of the relevance of the UN and the role of multilateralism in solving global challenges.

"In light of the continued COVID-19 global pandemic, the 42nd meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the parties to the Montreal Protocol (OEWG 42) convened three identical, online technical sessions, in different time zones, from 14-16 July 2020. During these sessions, the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) Replenishment Task Force on the replenishment of the Multilateral Fund (MLF) presented its report to the parties.As theEarth Negotiations Bulletinsummaryof the unusual OEWG notes, it was crucial that the Working Group prepare the way for the negotiation of the decisions to be adopted by the joint session of 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 12) to the Vienna Convention and 23rd Meeting of the Parties (MOP 23), which are tentatively scheduled for November 2020. In November, delegates will negotiate decisions related to funding that will support parties in phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The “MLF replenishment is a ‘do or die’ item for the Protocol as the current round of funding ends in December 2020.”During the online sessions, the ENB summary reports that Replenishment Task Force Co-Chairs Bella Maranion, Suely Carvalho and Shiqui Zhang presented an overview of the report, stating that the MLF Replenishment needs to take into account not only the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) phase-out but also the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) phase-down. Estimated funding requirements put forward by the RTF ranged from USD 376,697,000 to USD 808,706,000.Issues raised by parties during the discussions included:creating centers of excellence for those countries whose consumption of ozone-depleting substances classifies them as low-volume-consuming countries to aid in capacity building;considering the potential impact of COVID-19 on preserving the ozone infrastructure and implementation of future activities; andinsufficient funding for institutional strengthening.The online forum will reopen from 17-31 July 2020, providing parties with another opportunity to submit comments and questions on the report that have not yet been addressed. The OEWG 42 Co-Chairs will then compile and share these submissions with all parties. [ENB summary of OEWG 42][OEWG webpage]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"The European Commission (EC) has published its latest report on preventing or restricting the sale of dangerous products on the market. The report shows that authorities took more than 4,400 follow-up actions following alerts exchanged through the EC’s Rapid Alert System, or Safety Gate.The report titled,Saving Lives Every Day: 2019 Results from the Rapid Alert System for Dangerous Non-food Products, explains that, in 2019, authorities from 31 countries (EU Member States plus the UK, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) exchanged 2,243 alerts on dangerous products, prompting 4,477 follow-up actions (compared to 4050 for 2018). Actions taken included withdrawal or destruction of products by distributors and retailers before they reach consumers and recalling unsafe products. Since the end of 2019, work to protect consumers from dangerous products led to the flagging of an additional 75 products through theSafety Gate Rapid Alert System.The report identifies toys as the most notified product category (29% of total notifications), followed by motor vehicles (23%), and clothing, textiles and fashion items (8%). Cosmetics, electrical appliances and equipment, and childcare articles and children’s equipment also had high alert numbers. The most notified risks related to: a product causing injuries (27%), such as fractures or concussions; chemical components in products (23%); and choking risks for children (13%).Since the outbreak of COVID-19 until 1 July, 63 alerts related to face masks. Smaller numbers of alerts related to coveralls, hand disinfectants, and UV sanitizing wands. Between 1 March and 1 July, 10 follow-up actions were taken on facemasks, and one on a hand disinfectant.Avirtual catalogue provides examplesof some products notified under the Rapid Alert System. For each entry, it identifies the country, product category, specific product, technical defect and risk, and measure taken. In addition, aFactsheetsummarizes the highlights and findings.In addition, the Commission published the results ofCoordinated Activities on the Safety of Products (CASP), which are organized annually. These efforts led to testing the safety of 652 products, including personal transport devices, soft-filled toys, chargers, batteries, bicycle seats for children, and slime toys. 38% of the products were non-compliant with specific aspects of EU safety legislation, while 11% of products posed serious risks for consumers. Soft-filled toys presented the highest serious risk rates. The product is notified in the Rapid Alert System if a serious risk is determined. Other CASP for 2020 include: risk assessment; online market surveillance; cooperation with customs; injury and accident data collection; and communication campaigns. CASP 2021 priorities are currently being established.The Rapid Alert System was established in 2003 to enable quick information exchange between countries and the Commission about dangerous non-food products posing a risk to the health and safety of consumers. The System’s website provides weekly updates of alerts submitted by participating national authorities. Specific alerts can be prioritized and processed immediately at arrival, as was done for unsafe facemasks in April 2020.TheBusiness Gatewayinforms national authorities about a potentially unsafe product they have put on the market. TheProduct Safety Pledgeestablishes voluntary actions that go beyond what is already established in EU legislation. Seven online marketplaces have already pledged to cooperate with Member States to remove dangerous products from their websites.",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"9 July 2019: An event held on the sidelines of the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) explored the interlinkages between the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, the African Union’s ‘Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want’ and the Paris Agreement on climate change.The event titled, ‘Science to Power Sustainable Development Goals: 11 Years to Maximize on Synergies and Opportunities between the Paris Agreement and UN 2030 Agenda,’ identified opportunities for research and partnerships among stakeholders, reinforcing SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), in particular. It also focused on ways to make progress on SDG 13 (climate action), and provided recommendations for African countries to ensure more inclusive policies.The event, organized by the UN University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (UNU-INRA) and the UNU Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), argued that transformative governance requires accelerating decarbonization, circularity and inclusiveness. Participants discussed mainstreaming climate change across the two Agendas, and challenges relating to water, energy, land degradation, and management of marine ecosystems.The event concluded that: implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Agenda 2063 and the Paris Agreement remains uncoordinated between African countries; the SDGs provide an opportunity for African countries to maximize synergies; and sustainable development implementation requires investment in data collection to support operationalization of national development plans and networks that facilitate knowledge exchange.During the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, emphasized the importance of investment in science and research to connect international goals, and a transformative approach to climate change.Dirk Messner, UNU-EHS, highlighted six transformation arenas: human capacity and demography; consumption and production; decarbonization and energy; food, biosphere and water; smart cities; and digital revolution. He further underscored the four principles of transformative governance, decarbonization, circularity, and inclusiveness at local and global scales, stressing their importance for SDG implementation.Sam Nujoma, Marine and Coastal Research Centre, University of Namibia, discussed how science has been powering SDG implementation in ocean systems, and solutions adopted in Namibia, including desalination using wave power.IISD Reporting Services is providing coverage ofselected side eventsduring the 2019 HLPF.

"A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) provides an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG targets 2.1 (food insecurity) and 2.2 (malnutrition), and micronutrient deficiencies, in Europe and Central Asia (ECA). The assessment is complemented by a review of recent policy measures taken to address food security and nutrition in all its dimensions, and by recommendations for policymakers.Titled ‘Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in Europe and Central Asia,’ the report launch took place on 17 December 2019 in Moscow, Russia.The report introduces an analysis based on the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity as well as on Food Insecurity Experience Scale surveys. It finds that “the prevalence at the moderate or severe level could be quite high, at an average of 11% for the ECA region, affecting more than 100 million people.” The report points out that “progress in reducing undernourishment and food insecurity has not only slowed but has virtually halted in the past three to four years – even reversing slightly in several countries.” Further, per the publication, all countries in the region register adult obesity that is greater than the global average of 13.2%, with some countries registering a prevalence twice as high as the world average.With regard to healthier diets, the publication notes that the region has made “good progress” making fruit and vegetables more available for consumption.The publication addresses two drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition, namely socio-economic inequalities and government expenditures on agriculture. It emphasizes the need to consider socio-economic inequalities in the design of food and nutrition policies, programmes and interventions. A special section of the report looks at structural transformations currently taking place in Europe and Central Asia with regard to the economy, agriculture and food production, food consumption patterns and diets, and policies.Some of the recommendations the report advances include:making food and agricultural policies and practices more nutrition-sensitive;promoting the diversification of farming;supporting small-scale and family farms, including through policies that create a market for extra output and social protection policies that can support the adoption of new technologies; andincentivizing healthy diets while discouraging unhealthy ones.The publication underscores the need for governments to fill data gaps to enable in-depth, evidence-based policy analysis and subsequent better decision-making.

"24 September 2019: Together 2030 and Newcastle University have released the results of a survey on stakeholder engagement in national review and implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. The authors report progress on increasing civil society awareness and participation in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) since the beginning of the reviews in 2016, but point to little progress on SDG implementation following the VNRs.Titled ‘Commitments and challenges: stakeholder participation in follow up and review of the Sustainable Development Goals, 2019,’ thereportdiscusses results gathered through a perception survey that took place online from 10 June to 4 July 2019. The survey placedparticular focuson data from civil society organizations based in the 47 countries presenting VNRs at the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Those countries were: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Eswatini, Fiji, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nauru, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Serbia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, UK, Tanzania and Vanuatu.The survey found that, among the 159 respondents, 92% were aware that their country was undertaking a VNR in 2019, compared to 80% in 2018 and 68% in 2017. However, it also found that only a quarter or less of respondents saw good progress since “a past VNR” in many areas, including public awareness, political leadership, implementation of policies, and budget allocation.On leaving no one behind, the report indicates that only 27% of respondents said vulnerable and marginalized groups were involved in their government’s VNR preparation, and notes that VNR processes continue to exclude left-behind groups. The report further identifies obstacles to participation, such as lack of information and funding, not being given the opportunity to participate, and language barriers.Among other recommendations, the authors call on governments to:establish participatory and inclusive national review processes that maximize chances for “meaningful engagement” by stakeholders;ensure that vulnerable and marginalized groups are fully involved in the preparation of VNR reports; anddevelop and publish “leave no one behind” engagement strategies, outlining ways for the voices of those traditionally left behind to feed into the national development discourse.The authors also call on civil society organizations to increasingly work together, through formal or informal coalitions, to ensure clarity and transparency about how the government can engage them. They further call for considering how the VNRs can catalyze policy change, political will and public awareness within reporting countries.Current practices in the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda will be the subject of UN General Assembly (UNGA) consideration during the 74th session. This process will follow UNGA decisions to review progress on the implementation of UNGA resolutions related to the HLPF (66/290 and 70/299) during its 74th session “to benefit from lessons learned” from the Forum’s first cycle.

"Participants at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP13) issued the Gandhinagar Declaration, which calls for migratory species and the concept of “ecological connectivity” to feature in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The declaration was named for the COP’s host city in India.In addition to the Declaration’s call, a High-Level Segment also contributed outcomes for integration in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which is expected to be adopted at the UN Biodiversity Conference, in October, in Kunming, China. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Acting Executive Secretary, informed COP 13 participants that the post-2020 biodiversity framework will be simple and transformative, but unlikely to include targets other than those already in the Aichi Targets.Towards this end, the High-Level Segment discussed priorities for migratory species conservation in the framework, with speakers highlighting that this was the first CMS COP since the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) sounded the alarm that a million species, including many migratory species, might be lost in the coming decade. Ministers and other high-level participants emphasized the need to mainstream biodiversity across all sectors, including through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches. They also called for including migratory species considerations in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions on climate change.In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices.In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices. Seven were added to Appendix I, which comprises migratory species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The seven species added to Appendix I included the Asian elephant, jaguar, great Indian bustard, Bengal florican, little bustard, antipodean albatross and the oceanic white-tip shark.The Urial sheep, smooth hammerhead shark, and the tope shark were listed for protection under Appendix II, which covers migratory species that have an unfavorable conservation status and that require international cooperation for their conservation and management. In addition, new and extended Concerted Actions with targeted conservation plans were approved for 14 species.TheEarth Negotiation Bulletinreportfrom COP13 also indicates that Parties also agreed on the following measures benefiting migratory species:integrate biodiversity and migratory species considerations into national energy and climate policy and promote wildlife-friendly renewable energy;strengthen initiatives to combat the illegal killing, taking, and trade of migratory birds;mitigate the impacts of linear infrastructure on migratory species;deepen the understanding of the importance of animal culture and social complexity for the conservation of endangered species; andinvestigate possible trade in CMS Appendix I species and the implications for their conservation status.CMS COP13 and the associated meetings of the Standing Committee met from 15-22 February 2020. It brought together 2,550 people, including 263 delegates representing 82 parties, 11 delegates from five non-party countries, 50 representatives from UN agencies, 70 representatives of international non-governmental organizations, 127 representatives of national non-governmental organizations, and over 100 members of both national and international media.

"June 2019: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) issued a background note in preparation for the upcoming review of SDG 4 (quality education), which will take place as part of the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The note provides information on global progress toward SDG 4 and other education-related SDG targets, and offers 13 recommendations for improving countries’ performance, as well as “guiding questions” for the review meeting.The note highlights that global progress has been made, especially in the area of primary and lower secondary school completion, but progress has stalled in recent years, and more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics – including 20% of students in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.Among adults, around 750 million adults are illiterate; half of these adults live in Southern Asia and one-quarter in sub-Saharan Africa, while two-thirds of illiterate adults are women. Monitoring progress remains a challenge, and the note draws attention to ongoing efforts to improve monitoring and reporting on inequalities in education through the World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) platform.Among the recommendations, the note suggests: ensuring the right to safe, quality education and learning through life; providing greater support and resources for the professional development of teachers; eradicating illiteracy through formal and non-formal education and training; and including migrants, displaced persons, returnees, asylum seekers, refugees and stateless persons in education and training systems, and facilitating recognition of their qualifications. The note also calls on countries to adhere to the international benchmarks of allocating at least 4-6% of GDP and at least 15-20% of public expenditure to education, in order to meet SDG 4 targets.The authors note that countries that have achieved higher standards of education have high and universal expectations of students and focus on good teaching; these countries also target resources to struggling students and schools, and have long-term, coherent education strategies.Other SDG targets that relate to education address health and wellbeing (SDG target 3.7), gender equality (SDG target 5.6), decent work (SDG target 8.6), responsible consumption and growth (SDG target 12.8), and climate change mitigation (target 13.3).The HLPF’s in-depth review of SDG 4, the first such review since the Goals took effect in 2016, will take place on 9 July 2019.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) and six multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint statement highlighting measures taken to step up trade finance programmes to combat the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.The 1 July 2020 statement, signed by the WTO, International Finance Corporation (IFC), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Asian Development Bank (ADB), African Development Bank Group (AfDB), Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC), and the InterAmerican Development Corporation (IDB Invest), promises to address shortages in trade finance and outlines actions already taken.These actions, the statement notes, will ensure that the pandemic does not “prevent otherwise-viable trade transactions, including for essential goods such as food, drugs and medical equipment.” While trade finance is generally seen as “low risk,” deteriorating economic conditions have caused banks to become increasingly risk averse, a WTO press release highlights. Accordingly, banks and financial institutions have become wary of financing cross-border transactions out of “fear of non-payment.”The joint actions will serve as a force multiplier for future programmes on trade finance.Such behavior change, the statement emphasizes, not only impedes import of essential goods, but also stymies export of key income-generating products, placing disproportionate strain on micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the livelihoods of poor people. The statement’s annex highlights signatories’ actions taken to date, including: a USD 6 billion trade and working capital finance initiative by the IFC as part of a USD 14 billion COVID-19 crisis response facility by the World Bank; a USD 2.45 billion trade and supply chain programme as part of the ADB’s USD 20 billion package to support developing member countries; USD 1.5 billion in financing for trade from the EBRD; USD 1 billion in trade finance liquidity and risk mitigation support from the AfDB to local banks in member countries; and a USD 850 million intervention by the ITFC.Despite these actions, the statement underscores that additional effort is needed, especially “as the steep decline in the real economy starts to impact the financial system through loan defaults and corporate bankruptcies.” The signatories commit to continue assessing market developments as needs evolve and to act within their respective mandates to reduce trade finance gaps that emerge during this crisis.WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo described the efforts as marking “the first time the major multilateral development banks have lined up together in support of trade finance markets.” He noted that the joint actions “will serve as a force multiplier” for future programmes on trade finance.  The signatories urge other institutions to join them in their efforts.

The article published inNaturepresents a roadmap for integrating citizen science data in the SDGs.The article titled, ‘Citizen science and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,’ highlights that traditional data sources “are not sufficient” for measuring the SDGs, and new and non-traditional data sources will be required.UNEP statistician and a co-author of the study, Jillian Campbell, said “we have insufficient data for tracking global progress for 68% of the environment-related SDG indicators.” Campbell stressed the world “will never be able to monitor” the environmental dimensions of the SDGs using traditional data sources alone. Within this context, UNEP and others are highlighting the potential of data generated by citizens and their organizations, or “citizen science,” in helping to monitor the SDGs.Citizen-science data is already being used in support of SDG indicators. The article shares several examples of non-traditional data sources that contribute information relevant for SDG monitoring, from official sensor networks for monitoring weather, air pollution and traffic, to commercial data sets maintained by telecommunication and utility companies.The authors address concerns regarding the quality of citizen-science data, sharing citations that show that citizens can “make valuable and scientifically valid contributions that are on par with professional scientists.” For example, the Mosquito Alert citizen-science initiative has demonstrated that its data collection can be “quicker and cheaper” and obtained with “the same level of accuracy of traditional methods.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List Index is another example. The authors share measures to evaluate the quality of citizen science, and highlight the development of approaches to handle data quality concerns.The article provides a roadmap for integrating citizen science into formal SDG reporting mechanisms at global and national levels. At the global level, citizen science can help identify candidate indicators for the global SDG indicator framework, identify relevant citizen-science projects and develop protocols to ensure data quality. At the national level, citizen science can: mobilize and integrate citizen science stakeholders and communities; map existing citizen science contributions to SDG indicators; promote dialogue on data quality, metadata, standards and interoperability; create an inventory of examples and good practice; build on existing policy frameworks that advocate citizen science for decision-making; and integrate citizen science data streams into practices of countries’ National Statistical Offices (NSOs). One existing example is the EU-funded WeObserve project that maps contributions from citizen science to SDG indicators.The article concludes that success in integrating citizen science into SDG monitoring will require leadership from the UN, innovation from NSOs and focus from the citizen-science community.

"The Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) released an updated version of its SDG-Human Rights Data Explore, which allows users to explore the links between human rights and the SDGs. The update expands the database to illustrate how anti-corruption and responsible tax practices can contribute to the SDGs.DIHR released anexperimental versionof the ‘Sustainable Development through Human Rights Due Diligence Database’ database in April 2018 and anupdated versionin January 2019. The database aims to promote a more coherent, systematic framework for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as well as to facilitate its follow-up and review. The database uses an algorithm to automatically identify links between the SDG targets and over 150,000 recommendations and observations from international human rights mechanisms, including the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), UN Treaty Bodies and the Special Procedures under the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).The database now includes ‘tax, anti-corruption and human rights’ as a human rights issue. The database notes that the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have identified corruption and tax crime as “key obstacles to sustainable economic, political and social development, particularly in developing and emerging economies.” They note that bribery, corruption and tax evasion increase inequality and reduce efficiency. Further, tax is a key tool for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to protect, promote and fulfill human rights and implement the SDGs.Case briefs highlight examples of corporate leaders pushing for transparency tax systems and multi-stakeholder group efforts to end corruption. Other cases share how an energy company has called on its peers to demand increased tax transparency, and how a telecommunications company has published country-by-country tax information. Each case highlights the connections between tax, anti-corruption and human rights with relevant SDG targets, including several targets from SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

"In the paper titled, ‘How to Halt the Global Decline of Lands,’ the lead authors of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ‘Assessment of Land Degradation and Restoration’ present five systemic policy barriers to land restoration and propose 10 solutions for overcoming them.Thepaperpublished inNature Sustainability(10 February 2020) notes that “Land degradation has negatively affected the living conditions of at least two-fifths of the people on Earth and it is estimated to be reducing global economic output by a tenth.” It also highlights the links between land degradation, climate change and biodiversity loss, and notes that land degradation is both avoidable and often reversible.Land degradation is estimated to be reducing global economic output by a tenth.The paper outlines five reasons for the systemic failure to protect lands. It highlights a lack of urgency in addressing land degradation, especially by those benefiting from its exploitation. Secondly, it notes that there is “little agreement on standardized ways of measuring land degradation,” and thirdly, notes that policymakers and consumers are often disconnected by space and time from the impacts on land of their decision making on land resources. Fourth, the paper underscores the multiplicity of forces affecting land health as well as the difficulty of teasing them apart. These include,inter alia, natural, cultural, demographic, economic, educational, technological and political forces. And finally, the paper calls out the impacts of limited institutional capacity and motivation to take action to address land degradation.The publication then presents 10 solutions to overcoming these five drivers of land degradation, especially given the context of the upcoming UN Decade on Land Restoration, set to commence in 2021. Solutions include:Recognizing that the benefits generated by healthy and productive land are a global good;Setting clear, quantifiable, legally binding and ambitious targets;Regularly collecting and evaluating information on the state of the land;Promoting local action to tackle land degradation based on local contexts and needs;Building on all pertinent knowledge sources, and not exclusively on conventional science;Taking into account all the substantive costs and benefits when making decisions that impact land;Reducing human demands for services delivered by land to match the capacity of the land to supply those services sustainably;Encouraging responsible trade and consumption;Strengthening judicial institutions for environmental action by citizens; andProviding a foundation for more sustainable relationships between people and land.The publication calls on public and private sector decision makers, scientists and citizens to each play their role in protecting and restoring land.

"23 September 2019: The NDC Partnership has launched an initiative to raise climate ambition and build a more sustainable future by limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and building resilience against the negative impacts of climate change. Through the ‘Climate Action Enhancement Package’ (CAEP), countries also drive the SDGs by integrating climate action into core development strategies.The CAEP was launched on the sidelines of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit by the NDC Partnership’s co-chairs Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Minister of Environment and Energy, Costa Rica, and Sigrid Kaag, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, the Netherlands.At a time when we need to move from promises to action, the NDC Partnership is a unique platform for change.CAEP offers fast-track support to countries scaling up their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. CAEP relies on the NDC Partnership’s approach of supporting countries by matching them with finance and expertise from a wide range of partners. The Package enhances member resources with a Technical Assistance Fund (TAF) backed by a number of donors.Under CAEP’s first call for proposals, 50 of the NDC Partnership’s member countries have proposed more ambitious climate plans by 2020, along with enhanced action to implement them, enabled by expertise and resources from across their governmental institutions and civil society. These plans are backed by financial and technical support from 30 international institutions.“The aim is to ensure that if a member country wants to increase the ambition of its NDC, it can count on the support of international partners to meet its goals,” said Kaag. “At a time when we need to move from promises to action, the NDC Partnership is a unique platform for change,” she noted.The NDC Partnership is a global coalition of countries and institutions seeking to drive transformational climate action and sustainable development. Partnership members leverage their resources and expertise to provide countries with the support they need to implement their NDCs. The NDC Partnership has more than 150 members, including developed and developing countries from all regions of the world, major international institutions and non-state actors.

"As part of the campaign on ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C — Our Only Future,’ 177 companies have pledged to set emissions reductions targets that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. This doubles the number of signatories that have committed to such action since the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019, when the first companies announced their commitment.The campaign announced the growing number of companies during theHigh-level Meeting of Caring for Climate, which convened on 11 December 2019, on the sidelines of the 25th session of the Conference to the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC, in Madrid, Spain. The UNFCCC, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Global Compact (UNGC) organized the event, which focused on private sector engagement and action to increase corporate support for enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the SDGs.The 177 companies’ current emissions are equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France.The 177 companies represent a combined annual direct emissions equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France. The companies have a combined market capitalization of over USD 2.8 trillion, represent over 5.8 million employees, have headquarters in 36 countries and span 36 sectors. The companies will set science-based targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which independently assesses corporate emissions reduction targets.UN Secretary-General António Guterreswelcomedthe announcement, saying he was encouraged that 177 major companies have committed to “set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets aligned with a 1.5°C future.” By stepping up, he said these companies are pioneering new ways of doing business, driving systemic change in the economy and signalling to consumers, investors and governments that they “intend to lead as the global economy undergoes a just transition to a net-zero future.” UNGC Executive Director Lisa Kingo stressed business leaders’ role in “challenging governments to urgently match their climate ambitions.”The ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C — Our Only Future’ campaign represents the business contribution to the Climate Ambition Alliance, a multi-stakeholder group convened by the COP 25 Presidency to work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. These companies join a group of investors who committed to converting their investment portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050 through the UN-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, as well as the 50 fashion industry companies that committed to align with a 1.5°C through theFashion Pact.

"2 August 2019: Held in the North Pacific and Western Pacific Marginal Seas region, the second regional workshop on the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) discussed solution-focused research strategies. Over 160 participants from 18 countries contributed to the three-day workshop by reflecting on science actions and identifying opportunities to support the Decade’s objectives and six societal outcomes.The Decade is galvanizing ocean stakeholders around the world behind a common framework to ensure that ocean science supports countries in achieving the SDGs, and it is supporting efforts to reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health. Its six societal outcomes include a clean ocean, a healthy and resilient ocean, a predicted ocean, a safe ocean, a sustainably harvested and productive ocean, and a transparent ocean, and accessible ocean.Participants referred to the Decade as a “once-in-in a lifetime opportunity to shape a better ocean science agenda.”The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) organized the workshop, which took place in Tokyo, Japan, to prepare for the upcoming Decade through engagement with different stakeholders in the region. According to UNESCO, the North and West Pacific region has a population of more than three billion people, making it the most densely populated area in the world. Activities that threaten the health and productivity of the ocean in the region include land-based pollution, increasing economic development and non-sustainable resource extraction, climate change, and habitat destruction. Human activities have also impacted local marine ecosystems and coastal waters.Workshop participants shared their perspective on the Decade, underscoring it as a “once-in-in a lifetime opportunity to shape a better ocean science agenda” and connect ocean science more closely to society. The workshop agreed on a range of actions and partnerships to promote the sustainable development of the worlds’ oceans.The UN held the first regional consultation on the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) in the South Pacific region, from 23-25 July 2019.

"The year 2020 was supposed to conclude with the adoption of a new ten-year set of global goals and targets to reverse the negative trend of biodiversity loss. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several negotiation sessions and the meeting during which the post-2020 global biodiversity framework was expected to be adopted – the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) – have been postponed until 2021. A key event on the 2020 agenda remains on the sustainable development calendar, albeit in a virtual format: the UN Summit on Biodiversity.To prepare for this meeting, share information with CBD Parties, and reinvigorate the global discussion on biodiversity issues, the CBD Secretariat organized a series of online sessions from 15-18 September 2020. The sessions were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the 24th meeting of the CBD’s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) and third meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI).The fifth edition of theGlobal Biodiversity Outlookwas launched on the first day of the virtual sessions. This flagship report provided a final report card on progress against the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by CBD Parties in 2010 and meant to be achieved by 2020. The report examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health. The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” to:enhance conservation and restoration of ecosystems;mitigate climate change;take action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation;move towards more sustainable production of goods and services; andreduce consumption and waste.On the second and third days, five countries presented reports on their implementation efforts, in an exercise to test a process for conducting party-led reviews of implementation of the Convention and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. This test was organized to support the effort to develop an enhanced review mechanism in the context of COP 15 and the post-2020 biodiversity framework.Also on the third day, participants discussed a report from the Expert Panel on Resource Mobilization, which has identified challenges, including the presence of subsidies that are harmful to biodiversity, a lack of mainstreaming, a failure to address the private sector and other financial mechanisms, and a lack of priority for biodiversity outside environment ministries.On the final day, the Co-Chairs of the Open-ended Working Group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, Basile van Havre and Francis Ogwal, provided an update on the zero draft of the framework. The Co-Chairs reported that the draft includes a new goal on means of implementation, milestones to ensure progress, and a deadline of 2030 for each target, among other changes. A target on the recovery and conservation of wild flora and fauna was added as well.TheUN Summit on Biodiversityis taking place as part of the opening weeks of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 75), with a high-level dialogue on the the theme, ‘Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development’.

"The Alliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA) is urging countries to incorporate “water-aware” climate policies in their Long-Term Strategies (LTS), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In a 16-page report, AGWA sets out principles and recommendations for integrating water in these climate action strategies and commitments.Under the Paris Agreement, 2020 will be the first year in which signatories communicate their LTS for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Countries are required to report every five years.The report, titled ‘Watering the NDCs: National Climate Planning for 2020 and beyond – How water-aware climate policies can strengthen climate change mitigation and adaptation goals,’ was developed based on the crowdsourcing of ideas from public, private and civil society partners in more than 100 countries. Examples of actions for robust and resilient water management strategies are provided for Egypt, Mexico, the Solomon Islands, and Uganda. The publication argues that national climate change planning is strengthened when climate action considers resilient water management. Conversely, countries are likely to fail in meeting their Paris Agreement commitments if they do not factor in water issues.In itskey messages, AGWA makes six recommendations for resilient water management: analyzing current water consumption, allocation and tradeoffs; investing in water-smart design and management systems, and moving away from water-intensive energy infrastructure; taking into account basin-wide conditions when planning water supply and allocation, and working through transboundary organizations, where appropriate; planning for unpredictability in water availability, for example through greater efficiency of water use, demand-reduction strategies, and increased storage capacity; undertaking ecosystem-based adaptation approaches to maintain freshwater ecosystems in good condition; and promoting cooperation on water allocation across sectors and borders.AGWA is a membership organization comprising development banks, public and private-sector actors, NGOs, and academia.

"20 June 2019: In preparation for the UN General Assembly’s first high-level review of progress on the 2030 Agenda, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are reporting on achievements in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for the 2000-2017 period, focusing on inequalities within and between countries. SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) contains targets on drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and sanitation services (SDG target 6.2).UNICEF and WHO collaborate on the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which monitors progress on WASH worldwide. The JMP report titled, ‘Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000-2017: Special focus on inequalities,’ presents data by country and region, as well as globally. TheJMP websitepresents the full datasets used to derive the estimates for each country.The report shows that some countries, such as Viet Nam, have made great progress toward closing service provision gaps within the country. However, the data shows that globally, it is still rural communities and those in the least developed countries (LDCs) that lack basic services.In 39 countries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, open defecation has increased.On drinking water, the population using safely managed services increased from 61% to 71% worldwide, and from 25% to 35% in LDCs. In the time period reviewed, out of every ten people who lacked access to safe drinking water, eight lived in rural areas, and nearly half lived in LDCs.On sanitation, the population using safely managed services increased from 28% to 45% globally, and sanitation services in rural areas increased from 22% to 43%. Over the reporting period, open defecation rates decreased from 21% to 9% globally, and from 7% to 2% in East and Southeast Asia. Viet Nam reduced national rates of open defecation from 18% to 3%, and also significantly increased parity of service coverage between urban and rural areas, and between the richest and poorest wealth quintiles in urban areas.Despite these markers of progress, WHO and UNICEFemphasizethat the numbers of people lacking WASH access are still high: around 2.2 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water, 4.2 billion lack safe sanitation services, and three billion lack basic handwashing facilities. Quality of services also varies among different locations, and in 39 countries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa, open defecation has increased.Kelly Ann Naylor, UNICEF, urged governments to invest in poor and rural communities to bridge economic and geographic divides, and deliver “this essential human right.” Maria Neira, WHO, emphasized that providing WASH services will help wipe out diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid, and “is cost-effective and good for society in so many ways.”The report notes that in September 2019, the UNGA will hold an ‘SDG Summit,’ a meeting of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) at the level of heads of state and government, to review overall progress on the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs.

"June 2019: A report by the Circle Economy, a membership-based organization, has provided a range of recommendations for municipalities to promote the transition from a linear to a circular economy. The report, based on research in several European cities, argues that municipalities and governments are responsible for creating conditions for the circular economy to thrive, and suggests that such a transition could create 700,000 new jobs in the EU by the year 2020.The report titled, ‘The Role of Municipal Policy in the Circular Economy: Investment, Jobs and Social Capital in Circular Cities’, presents the findings of a study by Circle Economy and the Erasmus Happiness Economics Research Organisation, supported by the Goldschmeding Foundation. In the 34-page report, the authors propose that governments adopt strategies and targets to help the business community share societal and environmental objectives, provide loans and subsidies for circular economy activities, and promote networks and information sharing. The report includes examples of local government action on circular economy in European cities, including Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam, and Birmingham. It also highlights the work of companies engaged in circular economy activities, including sustainable transport and logistics, and avoidance of food waste.The concept of a circular economy was highlighted during the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) as a way of achieving SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production as well as other Goals. An October 2018 joint meeting of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s Economic and Financial Committee (the Second Committee) and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on Circular Economy for the SDGsnotedthat the concept has particular application to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).Circle Economydescribesits mission as accelerating the transition to circularity through the development of practical and scalable solutions and international campaigns. Its membership is made up of businesses and institutions that share this aim, including Oxfam. The Amsterdam-based organization has programmes on cities, jobs, textiles, the built environment, finance, and “remanufacturing.” [Publication:The Role of Municipal Policy in the Circular Economy: Investment, Jobs and Social Capital in Circular Cities]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
"22 September 2019: The World Bank launched the Clean Cooking Fund during the high-level event on the energy transition track of the UN Secretary-General’sClimate Action Summit. Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK have announced contributions or support to the Fund.During a session titled, ‘Energy Fueling People Clean Cooking, Energy and Health,’ Filippo Grandi, High Commissioner, UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), noted that the vast majority of world’s 71 million refugees and displaced people do not have access to sustainable and clean cooking.In addition to the Clean Cooking Fund, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank launched the Health and Energy Platform of Action (HEPA), which aims to help countries strengthen the political and technical cooperation between the health and energy sectors. Participants also proposed a High-Level Coalition of Leaders for Clean Cooking, Energy and Health to be supported by HEPA in collaboration with governments and stakeholders and to be launched in conjunction with the African Union Summit in January 2020.Speakers called on all governments to make clean cooking solutions a top political priority.In conclusion, moderator Kandeh Yumkella, Rapporteur, Clean Cooking, Energy and Health, highlighted that speakers had stressed that global energy transformation must be accelerated to achieve both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change and recognized that the world is currently not on track to meet the SDGs, including SDG 7 (on affordable and clean energy) or to keep global temperature rise this century below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. He also noted that speakers had called on all governments to make clean cooking solutions a top political priority and to put in place specific policies, cross-sectoral plans, and public investments to catalyze much larger amounts of private financing.Also during the high-level event, in a session titled ‘Energy Fueling Development,’ many speakers discussed the potential of renewables and energy storage, with several highlighting the World Bank’s Energy Storage Partnership. The importance of risk mitigation to promote increased investments in renewable energy at the institutional, transactional and project levels was also discussed, with announcements of support to the World Bank’s Solar Risk Mitigation Initiative.

"The seventh session of the Committee on Trade and Investment of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) stressed the role of international trade and investment and resilient supply chains in COVID-19 recovery. High-level delegates endorsed several recommendations, and underscored the role of cooperation in recovery.ESCAP convened the Committee’s meeting from 27-29 January 2021. It took place alongside the seventh Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Week, a series of virtual events on trade policy responses to the pandemic, digital trade facilitation, graduation from least developed country (LDC) status, and capacity building and analytical tools developed by ESCAP.In 2020, ESCAP estimates, Asia and the Pacific lost USD 2.2 trillion in trade based on pre-pandemic growth forecasts. Trade in services was affected the most. Foreign investment also recorded significant declines.UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, said the region needs to build on and expand existing cooperation frameworks, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Framework Agreement on Facilitating Paperless Trade, and the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement. She emphasized the importance of pushing “the frontiers of cooperation” to meet the challenges of post-COVID-19 recovery. Other participants highlighted the role of the rules-based trading system and regional economic architecture in enabling economic growth and recovery, including to deliver employment, well-being, and sustainable development.Delegates endorsed a number of recommendations to restore greater cooperation among countries and address the pandemic’s effects, including to resist unilateral protectionist actions, particularly in sectors linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to promote inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) in support of sustainable development. They also supported efforts to safeguard and strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system (MTS) and to harmonize digital trade rules.The Committee recommended ESCAP continue enhancing the Trade Intelligence and Negotiation Advisor (TINA), an online tool that aims to support preparations for trade negotiations, including features that enable trade agreement text analysis. ESCAP notes that tasks such as analytical and data management are time consuming when performed manually. TINA automates these tasks, enabling countries with limited resources to benefit from a similar level of preparation as larger economies. Most recently, the Government of Bangladesh used TINA to assist with a feasibility study of a trade agreement between Bangladesh and India. [ESCAP Press Release] [Seventh Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Week] [ESCAP Webpage on TINA] [ESCAP February Newsletter]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"7 October 2019: The UN will conduct a review of its peacebuilding architecture in 2020, as called for in the review conducted in 2016. The scope, modalities and terms of reference for the 2020 review are outlined in a proposal submitted to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and UN Security Council.In 2016, through their respective resolutions A/RES/70/262 and S/RES/2282, UNGA and the Security Council mandated a comprehensive review of the UN peacebuilding architecture to take place during the UNGA’s 74th session (2019-2020). The chair of the UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), Guillermo Fernandez de Soto (Colombia), prepared a proposal reflecting an “extensive consultative intergovernmental process” with PBC members, the co-facilitators of the2016 review, and the countries that have engaged with the PBC.The proposal suggests that the review process be informed by the report of the UN Secretary-General on peacebuilding and sustaining peace due at UNGA 74. Discussions convened by Member States, experts, and civil society at the UNGA, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the PBC at regional or country level could also inform the review “as appropriate,” the text notes.Fernandez de Soto’s document proposes two stages: a formal and an informal process. In the informal process, the PBC will convene meetings open to all UN Member States, relevant parts of the UN system, civil society representatives and independent experts “as agreed by the Peacebuilding Commission members.” These meetings are to: consider progress in the implementation of current resolutions; consider the recommendations contained in the 2018 report of the Secretary-General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace; consider the implications of ongoingUN reformson the peacebuilding architecture; and consider the views expressed by civil society, research organizations and other relevant partners with regard to the resolutions on the peacebuilding architecture and the recommendations provided by the Secretary-General in his 2018 and 2019 reports on the matter.A Chair’s summary is to be circulated after each of these meetings, with the PBC Chair to send the main findings of the informal process to the UN Secretary-General, the UNGA and the Security Council for their consideration in the formal process. Member States are also invited to organize regional and thematic consultations, and two or three “eminent persons” to be selected are to submit a letter containing their views to the Secretary-General and Member States. These inputs will be considered in the formal process as well.Once the informal process concludes, the UNGA and UNSC Presidents will initiate an intergovernmental process to review the inputs. They could also organize informal interactive dialogues with the PBC.UNGA and the Security Council are to decide the modalities for the intergovernmental process.

"25 September 2019: The world is “significantly off track” to achieve SDG 1 (no poverty), the latest Overseas Development Institute (ODI) assessment finds, estimating that 430 million people will still live in extreme poverty by 2030. According to ODI, most countries can afford the investment to end extreme poverty if they maximize taxation and allocate 50% of public spending to human development. However, 46 countries will face a £222 billion funding shortfall.The report reiterates the findings of the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 SDG Progress Report, noting that, of the world’s people: 1 in 12 are living in extreme poverty; one in nine are hungry; 50% lack essential healthcare; 50% are not covered by social protection; and one in five children does not attend school.The authors predict that economic growth will cut poverty rates by one-third by 2030, with poverty remaining concentrated in fragile states (86% of the total) and in low-incomes countries (LICs). While half of the extreme poor will still be in middle-income countries (MICs), the publication mentions that they will account for “a relatively small share of the population”: 3% in MICs compared to 25% in LICs.More investment in effective education, health and nutrition, and social protection programmes could end extreme poverty.The publication focuses on public finance (tax and aid), explaining that private finance is rarely used as a major source for the provision of basic social services. The briefing note updates the cost estimates of eradicating poverty for all 138 LICs and MICs, including all 47 least developed countries (LDCs), as well as the cost estimates for a set of social protection programmes designed at the scale needed to lift everyone out of extreme poverty in each country.The assessment recommends that LDCs to increase their tax revenues by a quarter (to the maximum level that is economically feasible) and to allocate half of their public spending to health, education and social protection.In order to close the financing gap and meet SDG 1 by 2030, the publication underscores that Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors need to:Double their collective aid, with all donors meeting the 0.7% official development assistance (ODA) target;Double the share of their collective aid given to the LDCs from one-quarter to a half; andPress all multilateral agencies with a global reach to provide at least half of their support to the poorest countries.Generally, more investment in effective education, health and nutrition, and social protection programmes could end extreme poverty.The report waslaunchedon the sidelines of the UNGA’s high-level week, on 25 September 2019, in New York, US.

"27 June 2019: A report launched by the World Bank Group ahead of the G20 Summit finds that people in developing countries spend half a trillion dollars annually (over USD 80 per person) out of their own pockets to access health services, with these expenses most affecting the poor, and proposes solutions. The publication informed a first-ever G20 Finance and Health Ministers joint session hosted by Japan as G20 President, on 28 June 2019 in Osaka.Financing universal health coverage (UHC) in developing countries has been underscored as a priority for Japan’s G20 Presidency, and was discussed also by the G20 Finance Ministers during their meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, from 8-9 June 2019. In theircommunique, the finance ministers highlighted that moving towards UHC contributes to human capital development, sustainable and inclusive growth and development, and prevention, detection and response to health emergencies such as pandemics and anti-microbial resistance. They recognized that a multi-sectoral approach, in particular the collaboration between finance and health authorities, with the “appropriate” contribution of the private sector and NGOs, is “crucial” for strengthening health financing, building on work by international organizations.By 2030 the 54 poorest countries will have a USD 176 billion gap for financing quality, affordable health services for their populations.The World Bank publication titled, ‘High-Performance Health Financing for UHC,’ finds that the majority of developing countries will fail to achieve their targets for UHC and the health- and poverty-related SDGs unless they take urgent steps to strengthen their health financing. It estimates that by 2030, the SDGs’ deadline, there will be a USD 176 billion gap in the 54 poorest countries between the financing needed to provide their populations with quality, affordable health services and funding that is actually available.To address that, the authors call for: increased national investments in health, and making investment in health a whole-of-government priority; improving financial sustainability by scaling proven investments like primary health services that reach the poorest; and taxing tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks to raise revenue and improve health. It also underlines the need for new avenues for international collaboration to support country UHC financing efforts in two main areas: health-financing research and development; and a “sizeable” increase paired with a strategic shift in development assistance for health toward strengthening health-financing leadership, governance and organizational capacity, improved domestic resource use and mobilization, and increased global health security.The report further finds that, even in the best-case scenario with greater, more efficient and more equitable country and international investments, the 2030 UHC financing gap will not be closed, and it urges that health financing be a priority for innovation over the next decade to help bridge the gap.Speaking on the report launch, Mohamed Maait, Minister of Finance of Egypt and African Union (AU) Chair, said that in February 2019 the AU committed to increase national investments in health in the region, and to institutionalize collaboration between Ministers of Finance and Health in Africa.

The agreement could help to ensure that trade rules support progress towards SDG 2 (zero hunger).In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries initially restricted food exports, raising concerns that poor consumers in net food-importing countries would face difficulties in accessing food. In an informal WTO meeting on 10 November, WFP staff said the organization had faced difficulties procuring humanitarian aid in the new market and policy environment. Singapore then introduced a proposal to exempt from export restrictions food bought for humanitarian purposes ahead of the WTO’s General Council meeting on 16 December.On 21 January 2021, 53 WTO members released a joint statement that recognizes the “critical humanitarian support” provided by the WFP.

"The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) have published the first-ever Europe Sustainable Development Report, assessing quantitative progress of the EU and its member states towards the SDGs. The report notes that European countries lead globally on the SDGs, but none are on track to achieve the Goals by 2030.The 2019 Europe Sustainable Development Report, released on 19 November, finds that:The ten countries closest to achieving the SDGs are in Europe – Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovania and Estonia – but no European country is on track to achieve the Goals;The greatest challenges facing the EU and its member states in achieving the Goals relate to climate, biodiversity, the circular economy and on strengthening the convergence in living standards across countries and regions; andEuropean countries generate large, negative spillovers that impede other countries’ ability to achieve the SDGs, such as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), biodiversity loss embodied in trade, banking secrecy and weapons exports.The report outlines six transformations that pose challenges for the EU, but have the potential to promote the 17 SDGs: well-educated workforce and innovative economy, built on excellence in education, gender equality and social protection; health and wellbeing for all, built on universal health coverage and healthy lifestyles; climate-neutral and circular economy, based on decarbonizing energy systems by 2050 and massively increasing resource efficiency in European industry; sustainable food systems, land use and oceans, built on efficient and sustainable agriculture, conservation and restoration of nature, healthy diets, and sustainable food processing and international value chains; sustainable cities and communities that are productive, healthful, inclusive and green, with a particular focus on small towns and rural communities; and digital and other modern technologies for sustainable development, built on excellence in key industries, while protecting privacy, human rights and social inclusion.The authors call on the European Commission, in collaboration with the European Parliament and the European Council, to ensure that EU processes are in place to achieve the SDGs, including under the framework of the European Green Deal. They also recommend that the EU define clear SDG targets to guide policy implementation and monitoring, and ensure coherence between the Goals and existing instruments and mechanisms, including budget, investment strategies, and regulatory governance and monitoring frameworks. They call on the EU to align its development cooperation with the SDGs to serve the needs of emerging economies and poor countries.An annex to the report provides profiles of the EU and each member state, as well as indicator profiles.

"27 September 2019: In an assessment of the state of Europe’s biodiversity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) finds that 58% of endemic trees (those that exist only in this region) in Europe are threatened by extinction. The assessment aims to improve knowledge of the continent’s biodiversity and evaluate overlooked species for the European Red List.The report titled, ‘European Red List of Trees,’ looks at the conservation status of the 454 tree species native to Europe and finds that 42% of trees regionally are threatened with extinction. Among Europe’s endemic trees, the assessment classifies 58% as threatened and 15% as critically endangered. TheSorbusgenus, which includes the Crimean Rowan and the Mountain-ash, are particularly affected, with 75% of Europe’s 170Sorbusspecies classified as threatened.The assessment identifies invasive species, unsustainable logging and urban development as key threats to Europe’s tree species. The leaf-miner moth, for instance, is an invasive species that originated in the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It invaded the rest of Europe, damaging horse-chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum), which are now classified as vulnerable. Additional threats to Europe’s tree species include agriculture and climate change.IUCN Red List Unit Head, Craig Hilton-Taylor said the European Red List assessment highlights the importance of both conserving these species and integrating them into “regular conservation planning and land management.” [IUCN Press Release] [Publication:European Red List of Trees]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"High-level speakers exchanged perspectives on how to build a global economic system based on social and economic inclusion, equity, and environmental justice, during the latest roundtable in the ‘Rebirthing the Global Economy’ series. The series is part of the Initiative on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, which is co-convened by Canada, Jamaica, and the UN.The roundtable took place virtually on 24 November 2020, organized by the Office of the UN Deputy Secretary-General.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrestold the groupthat one million people have died from the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has pushed 100 million into extreme poverty, doubled hunger, and increased inequalities. He said educational disruptions could create a “lost generation, especially for children trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide.” Guterres further lamented that the “gender equality gap is widening” and women’s labor force participation, a key driver for inclusive growth, “has been set back decades.” Guterres stressed that vaccines, tests, and treatments “must be global public goods, available and affordable for all.” He called for global coordination and emphasized the need to close the funding gap for vaccine affordability and accessibility.He also urged aligning recovery efforts with the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change. He called for a “quantum leap” towards a global coalition for net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, integrating carbon neutrality goals into all economic and fiscal policies, and implementing measures to transition towards green jobs.The World Bank Group’s Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart said many of today’s economic challenges pre-date COVID-19. She called for “realism and persistence” to support low-income and emerging markets to survive the pandemic.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde observed a need to focus on the millions of people at the bottom of the economic scale. Journalist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman called for disrupting the COVID-19 transmission chain, and providing economic compensation for those whose livelihoods have been negatively affected by pandemic-related restrictions.Previous roundtables in the series featured insights from women leaders and from young women economists on jobs and climate action.

"UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed briefed Member States on the ‘SDG Moment’ to be convened by the UN Secretary-General in September 2020. The SDG Moment is an annual event mandated by Heads of State and Government in the political declaration of the 2019 SDG Summit. It will take place as part of every high-level week of the UN General Assembly from 2020 to 2030.Speaking on 6 August 2020, Mohammed reminded delegates that the Moment is meant to serve as an “annual SDG check-in” and snapshot of progress, rather than a comprehensive picture of implementation. It will build on the most recent HLPF session, highlight shortfalls in implementation and investment, and showcase interventions underway to increase action.On the format, she said approximately 20 Heads of State and Government will be able to speak each year, with a three-minute slot. This ensures that all Member States can address the SDG Moment at least once in the coming 11 years.Mohammed said the proposed criteria for participation each year would require States to: be represented at the level of Head of State or Government; have completed at least one Voluntary National Review (VNR); and commit to discussing their implementation gaps as well as plans for filling those gaps. The line-up for each year also needs to ensure regional representation, gender balance, and representation of countries’ different circumstances.In 2020, the SDG Moment will take place for three hours on the morning of Friday, 18 September. She said most statements will be delivered virtually, although the possibility of a hybrid format is being considered.As next steps, the regional groups of Member States will be asked to nominate States to speak in September 2020. Nominees are requested by 21 August. [Briefing of UN Deputy Secretary-General] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on announcement of SDG Moments, September 2019]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has reported on the impacts of four years of work with businesses to set emissions reductions targets. The report findings amount to “a clear signal that the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway,” SBTi argues, as private sector action can lead governments to set more ambitious policies and regulations.SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Since its launch in 2015, over 680 companies have made a commitment to set science-based targets. Each participating company develops targets in a 24-month process and submits them to SBTi, which assesses them against scientific criteria.The report titled, ‘Raising the Bar: Exploring the Science Based Targets initiative’s progress in driving ambitious climate action,’ was published on 4 December 2019. It finds that:A total of 285 companies have set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with scientific guidance on averting dangerous climate change and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Of those 285 companies, 76 have set even more ambitious goals, aligning with limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.Meeting the targets of these 285 companies would mean an emissions reduction of 265 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which SBTi says is approximately equivalent to closing 68 coal-fired power plants.The 285 companies’ targets also will “drive investment of up to USD18 billion in climate change mitigation and spur up to 90 TWh of annual renewable electricity generation.”In some sectors, SBTi reports that over 20% of the high-impact companies have set science-based targets for emissions, showing that it is becoming standard business practice. These sectors include: apparel, biotechnology, food and beverage, healthcare, hospitality, information technology, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications. The report also notes that science-based targets have been approved for companies in high-emitting industries, such as cement, steel, chemicals and automobiles.According to Alexander Farsan, WWF, the participating companies “are proof that acting on climate science goes hand-in-hand with a successful business and economy” He added that companies that do not reduce their emissions according to scientific guidance “risk being left behind.”Among other highlights, the SBTi reports that Japan’s Ministry of Environment set a goal of having 100 Japanese companies with approved targets by 2020. By the end of October 2019, 52 Japanese companies had already done so. The report also finds that in emerging market countries, only a few companies have set science-based targets, with the exception of India, which has nine companies with approved targets.As of 30 January 2020, the ‘Companies Taking Action’ tracking tool on the SBTi website shows that 732 companies are taking science-based climate action, and 312 companies have approved science-based targets. The tool allows users to sort by company name, sector, location, and status (committed or targets set), among other information.

"26 September 2019: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has launched the Hand-in-Hand Initiative to enable “matchmaking” between countries with the highest poverty and hunger rates and those countries most able to offer support. Targeting highly-populated, less developed countries, the initiative aims to accelerate progress on the SDGs, especially with regard to ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2).The Hand-in-Hand Initiative was launched during an event that took place on 26 September 2019, at UN Headquarters in New York, US on the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). The event was designed to enable discussions with governments on how to engender a more dynamic and innovative FAO and strengthen North-South partnerships and best support the least developed Landlocked Countries (LLDCs), least developed Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and countries affected by food crises.FAO plans to do the “matchmaking” in partnership with multilateral development banks and other UN agencies. FAO will also seek opportunities at the national level for all priority countries, identify bottlenecks and investment gaps, and develop a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework “with clear targets” for 2030.

"In support of SDG target 12.3 (halve food waste and reduce food loss by 2030), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched a code of good practice for handling fresh produce to minimize loss along with a methodology for measurement.Thecode of good practicelaunched on 28 November provides guidelines on how to maintain quality and reduce food loss for three key groups along the fresh produce supply chain: producers, traders and retailers. The code covers issues ranging from staff training and production planning to storage, logistics and alternative marketing.Themethodology for measurementaims to simplify and ensure the systematic measuring of food loss and waste at several key points of the fresh produce supply chain. It includes a food loss and waste quantification method, a food loss and waste hotspot analysis method, and an analysis method for financial losses. It builds on existing methodologies in assessments globally and recent studies.The quantification method shows the quantity of loss at various nodes of the supply chain. For example, the difference between the quantity harvested (in kilograms) and the quantity transported to the wholesale. The hotspot analysis method reflects the throughput efficiency at various stages of the supply chain. For instance, the ratio of transported harvest to the actual harvest. The financial analysis takes into consideration the financial value of lost or wasted food as well as the cost of its transportation as applicable at various nodes. The methodology includes also a food loss and waste record sheet for daily use at every stage of the chain.The formulas are applicable at the production, post-harvest, wholesale, transportation and packing stages of the fresh- produce supply chain. They can be used by farmers, wholesalers, transporters and packing houses.The methodology aims to generate big data that can guide policy makers in integrating food loss and waste into strategies such as national agricultural development policies, as well as support private sector producers in finding solutions. UNECE mentions that the methodology could also be integrated into an IT-based smart food loss management system, adding that it is currently developing a blockchain-based online market for food that is lost or wasted in supply chains. The goal is to allow this “invisible” food to remain in the human consumption chain to the largest extent possible. The blockchain-based online market is expected to be launched in 2020.

"The UN Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) 2020 Handbook of Statistics shows that COVID-19 has contributed to significant declines in international trade, with services trade experiencing a drop not seen since 1990. The handbook provides a range of statistics and indicators on international trade in merchandise and services, investment, population, maritime transport, and development.This year’sonline editionadds new interactive charts and maps, enabling increased visibility of small territories and allowing for user customization.The handbook notes that the total value of world services exports in 2019 was valued at USD 6.1 trillion, after a “modest” 1.9% rise. Prior to COVID-19, between 2014 and 2019, all main service categories exports – transport; travel; insurance, financial, intellectual property, and other business services; telecommunications, computer, and information; and “other” categories – were increasing, with telecommunications experiencing the highest growth rates. However, in the wake of the pandemic, trade in services is likely to fall by 15.4% in 2020 compared with 2019, the handbook projects.A UNCTADpress releaseemphasizes the scale of the decline, flagging that it represents the largest drop in services trade since 1990, when the series began. Year-on-year, the handbook notes in a “nowcast” – UNCTAD’s data-led projections for the immediate future in response to increased demands for up-to-date statistics in light of the pandemic – that a 19.9% decline of services trade is expected this quarter relative to the third quarter of 2019. The plunge has been driven by sharp declines in travel, transport, and tourism activity, UNCTAD finds.On international merchandise trade, the handbook’s nowcast for the third quarter of 2020 shows that merchandise exports are down 11.9% relative to the third quarter of 2019. After a steep drop in the first two quarters of 2020 due to COVID-19, the handbook notes the beginnings of recovery. The US and China represent the largest share of bilateral flows of merchandise trade, but regional trade remains popular. The handbook shows that approximately 60% of Asia’s merchandise trade takes place within the region, and nearly 70% of Europe’s exports were intra-regional in 2019.In an unrelatednews releaseon data from the third quarter of 2020, the World Trade Organization (WTO) makes a similar observation on a trade rebound. The WTO finds that the third quarter of 2020 saw a partial recovery of world trade in manufactured goods, mostly in electronics, textiles, and automotive products. Services trade remains severely depressed, the WTO finds, despite having appeared “to have bottomed out” mid-year.Other key statistics noted in the handbook include maritime transport and population. The handbook shows that total seaborne trade volume was 11.1 billion tons in 2019, and that commercial fleet capacity grew by 4.1%. The world’s total population now stands at 7.7 billion people, growing at 1.1% per year.Classifications and calculation methods for the handbook’s statistics are available in an annex.

"The UN General Assembly and UN Security Council have concluded their 2020 review of the UN’s peacebuilding architecture. Adopting the agreed text, the two bodies decided to hold a high-level meeting of the UNGA during its 76th session (September 2021-September 2022) on ensuring adequate financing for peacebuilding.The review process was mandated by the UNGA and the Security Council and launched in October 2019. In February 2020, the Secretary-General appointed a group of Independent Eminent Persons to provide their perspectives on the review, and they issued aset of recommendationsin June.In September 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio GuterresbriefedMember States on efforts to shift to prevention over crisis response, as the human and financial cost of focusing primarily on crisis response is unsustainable. The 2030 Agenda calls for redoubled efforts to “resolve or prevent conflict,” and with SDG 16 governments commit to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions.In October 2020, the co-facilitators for the process, Craig John Hawke, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, and Inga Rhonda King, Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, issued a zero draft of the resolution and held readings of the text with UN Member States. The outcome of the consultations is aset of “twin” draft resolutionsfor the the UNGA and the Security Council, each adopted by their respective bodies on 21 December 2020.By the text, UN Member States express concern about the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world, especially in conflict-affected countries, and note that this could hamper progress towards the 2030 Agenda.At the UNGA meeting to take action on the draft text, UNGA President Volkan Bozkirsaidthe outcome puts “conflict prevention at the core of our actions. We are clearly restating that our efforts must address the structural causes of conflict and provide for inclusive and participatory political processes.” The representative of Egypt, for the African Peacebuilding Caucus, highlighted the emphasis on action to address remaining gaps. The representative of Japan, in his capacity as Vice-Chair of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, said the final text did not include an important reference to institution-building. He said this is a means of building and sustaining peace, as is financing, because trust in government is a precondition for tackling the root causes of conflicts. He added that institution building was a primary purpose of the PBC when it was created in 2005.Looking ahead, the resolution calls for a report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation of the resolutions in 2022 and a more detailed report in 2024, and for the next comprehensive review of UN peacebuilding to take place in 2025.

"1 July 2019: The Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (IOC-UNESCO) released a report card on the ocean observing system. They presented the report card during the IOC’s 30th General Assembly session.According to UNESCO, sustained ocean observation is critical for sustainable development and for monitoring progress towards the SDGs. The IOC is responsible for measuring SDG indicator 14.3.1 on ocean acidification. Coordinated monitoring of changes in ocean chemistry is essential for countries to report on SDG target 14.3 (“Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels”). In addition, climate scientists have identified ocean acidification as a “Global Climate Indicator,” one of a set of climate parameters that provides key information on climate change.On ocean acidification, the report card states that anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have “substantially increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations” over the last two centuries. This increase is causing changes in seawater chemistry and resulting in ocean acidification.In the report card, JCCOM calls on governments and other stakeholders to increase contributions to the ocean observing system to meet the need for ocean information and address a wide range of sustainability issues. JCCOM further calls for,inter alia, enhancing collaboration, openly sharing data and optimizing efforts and resources in support of global ocean observation.

"10 October 2019: The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Bank launched the Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement, in support of the Global Compact on Refugees adopted in 2017. Located in Copenhagen, Denmark, the Joint Data Center is expected to strengthen the sustainability of a global data collection system and of country-level systems regarding refugees and other displaced persons.The center was firstannouncedin October 2017. In April 2019, the CEO of the World Bank Group and the UN High Commissioner for Refugeessigneda Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish the center. The officiallaunchtook place on 10 October 2019, in Copenhagen.Present at the launch, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresnotedthe issue of having official statistics that are completely outdated and do not represent reality. He welcomed centers of excellence in different areas of UN system, where data is effectively collected and used.Per abrieffrom the World Bank, the Joint Data Center is managed and owned equally by UNHCR and the World Bank Group. A Strategic Advisory Council will include UN Member States, NGOs, UN agencies, “refugee voices,” multilateral development banks, academics and data specialists.As outlined byUNHCR, some of the objectives of the Center are to: ensure that population and socio-economic data are systematically collected and analyzed; facilitate open access to forced displacement data in full respect of legal protection standards; and promote innovation to enhance forced displacement data.The Center is expected to,inter alia:develop methodological tools (including standards, sampling methods, a framework for collection);implement capacity-building programmes for data collection in refugee-hosting countries;prepare a review of new technologies to enhance available data; andenhance UNHCR registration for the collection and analysis of socio-economic data.The Global Compact on Refugees wasadoptedby the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in December 2017 to ease pressure on host countries, enhance refugee self-reliance, expand access to third country solutions, and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity.In support of that Compact, UNHCR released in July 2019 an indicatorframeworkto strengthen the availability of global data. The framework is structured around the Compact’s four objectives outlined above, and is composed of outcomes and indicators. Each indicator is accompanied by a metadata overview specifying its concept, rationale and definition, together with the method of computation, level of disaggregation and data source.

"25 August 2019: The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) launched the Blue Peace Index, a tool to measure levels of cooperation on transboundary freshwater river basins. The Index comprises more than 50 qualitative and quantitative indicators on the use of shared water resources. It is meant to promote understanding of water for peace.Launched at the opening of World Water Week, TheBlue Peace Indexmeasures achievements in five areas relevant to policy and legal frameworks; institutions and participation; water management instruments; infrastructure and financing; and the context of cooperation. It also allows for monitoring achievement towards SDG target 6.5, which calls for implementing integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels, ‘including through transboundary cooperation, as appropriate’.In apresentationat World Water Week, Conor Griffin, EIU, anticipated that the tool would bring the topic to a non-specialist audience, spur a public debate around goals and best practices, highlight policy and technical solutions, and provide a tool for holistic and long-term assessment. He noted that water cooperation has many benefits, including greater agricultural productivity, water and sanitation for human health, access to water and energy services, and reduced damage from natural disasters.Water cooperation has many benefits, including for greater agricultural productivity, human health, access to energy, and reduced damage from natural disasters.His presentation highlighted results from applying the tool to five international river basins – the Amazon, Mekong, Sava, Senegal and Tigris-Euphrates. Based on the Index, the Sava River Basin in Europe scored the highest of the five at 67.9%, with its pollution control and data-sharing mechanisms helping to push it into a higher category. The Tigris-Euphrates scored lowest of the five at 25%, due to the absence of a regional cooperation mechanism andad hocarrangements made within a difficult political and environmental context.World Water Weekis organized annually by the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI).

"August 2019: The UNFCCC Adaptation Committee has a published an online report on approaches to long-term adaptation planning that addresses topics related to various approaches to enhance long-term adaptation planning and action and shares information with Parties as they engage in the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) processes.The UNFCCC Secretariat produced the report ahead of the 16th meeting of the Adaptation Committee, which will convene from 9-12 September 2019 in Bonn, Germany. The paper is intended as a contribution to the Committee’s work on offering technical support and guidance on adaptation action to Parties.The report recognizes the increased attention being paid to long-term adaptation planning as beneficial to enhanced adaptation action. It also emphasizes the need for integrating adaptation with the SDGs and with long-term national development plans to ensure an adequate adaptation response.The report describes the critical role that the NAP process plays in long-term adaptation planning, particularly as countries update their NAPs, by helping Parties to identify medium- and long-term adaptation needs, and to develop and implement strategies and programmes to address those needs. It contends that integrating NAPs into national development planning processes and strategies will help reduce vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change.The paper summarizes information on long-term adaptation planning that could be useful for Parties as they engage in the the process of formulating and implementing NAPs. While no “one-size-fits all” approach exists for long-term adaptation planning, according to the report, such planning can benefit from lessons learned from short-term projects by using capacity built and knowledge collected and generated.The report describes various approaches countries have used for long-term planning, many of which complement each other, including ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA), community-based adaptation (CBA), livelihood diversification and risk-based approaches. According to the paper, adaptation planners and implementers often use elements of several approaches to maximize advantages for a particular situation. A long-term adaptation approach, the publication notes, can help integrate adaptation into development planning processes and strategies, in a manner coherent between NAPs and the SDGs, within relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate.The report also addresses incremental versus transformational change, an iterative approach to long-term planning, and the importance of effective institutional arrangements and stakeholder engagement.

"4 July 2019: The 30th session of the Assembly of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC-UNESCO) reviewed progress on the Commission’s work, and agreed on future priorities. The Assembly welcomed the Commission’s progress on elevating awareness on SDG 14 (life below water) and the Commission’s role in developing accelerated methodologies for SDG 14 indicators.The 30th session of the IOC Assembly convened from 26 June to 4 July at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, France. The Assembly is composed of 150 member States, and is charged with establishing IOC-UNESCO’s general policy and main areas of work.The Assembly acknowledged the IOC’s role in advancing increased visibility on SDG 14. IOC-UNESCO is the custodian agency for the indicators for SDG target 14.3 on ocean acidification, and SDG target 14.a on marine scientific research. The Assembly recognized the Commission’s progress in developing accepted methodologies for measuring these two indicators, both of which are now classified as Tier II indicators. According to the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), a Tier II indicator has a clear methodology but inadequate data. Countries can now begin collecting global data for both indicators.More budgetary resources are needed to ensure the world does not undershoot our ambitions for the Decade.On climate change, the Assembly agreed to support countries to formulate ocean-related climate mitigation and adaptation strategies and on further cooperation and research on the ocean-climate nexus. The Assembly established a Joint IOC-World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Collaborative Board, which will work on disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate information.Also on cooperation, the Assembly encouraged the IOC Secretariat to strengthen joint activities in support of the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development for the years 2021-2030. The UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, called on IOC member States to increase budgetary resources to ensure the world does not “undershoot our ambitions for the Decade.” The Commission is also working to improve interactions between citizens and the ocean through increasing global ocean literacy. In addition, the IOC Secretariat will continue to provide a platform to enhance member States’ capacities, including through exchange of oceanographic data and information and best practices in ocean sciences, with an emphasis on vulnerable countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS).The Assembly agreed on a number of key programmes and initiatives, including Seabed 2030, an initiative that aims to map the entire seafloor by 2030. The Assembly also agreed on the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2). These initiatives aim to enhance understanding of the world’s oceans and provide information to support sustainable development, well-being and prosperity.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) released a report for the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) that highlights the WTO’s efforts to achieve trade-specific targets in the SDGs as well as the organization’s contribution to trade across all the SDGs.The report titled, ‘WTO Contribution to the 2020 HLPF,’ highlights that the multilateral trading system has contributed to “unprecedented economic development” over the last few decades, and observes that increased certainty over trade policies has resulted in predictability and created the conditions for long-term business planning and investment. The report underscores the role of trade, fiscal, and monetary policies in achieving the SDGs and supporting sustainable development. For example, the report highlights discussions with the WTO Committee on Trade and the Environment on domestic initiatives on waste and chemicals management and recycling and on how trade policy can support the circular economy. In addition, the Aid for Trade initiative contributes to SDG target 8a (increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs)), and gender-responsive trade policies contribute to increasing women’s participation in global trade (in line with SDG 5) while contributing to economic growth (in line with SDG 8).The report provides a review of the WTO’s efforts on SDG 14.6 on prohibiting fisheries subsides that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and on SDG 17.10 on promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system. The report states that discussions on reducing harmful fisheries subsidies are playing a critical role in advancing developing countries’ sustainable development objectives.The report recommends that governments mainstream trade into their national development plans, including by defining a clear national trade policy, ensuring effective institutional coordination, and integrating trade into sector strategies. To support progress on SDG 17.11 (doubling LDCs’ share in global trade by 2020), the report emphasizes the need for measures that address challenges faced by LDCs in international trade to ensure a more equitable distribution of trade benefits.The report also considers the potential impact of COVID-19 on global trade, and shares steps taken by WTO members to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The report reflects that the COVID-19 crisis has had a “major impact” on global supply and demand, resulting in disruptions of global supply chains for goods and services, and concludes that expectations of recovery in the value of world trade “will need to be revised downwards.” The report welcomes the introduction of fiscal and monetary measures by governments to prevent social lockdowns from creating large-scale business failure and job losses. The WTO emphasizes the importance of maintaining open trade and investment flows to protect jobs, reduce disruptions in global supply chains, and ensure that products are available for all.The WTO reports annually to the HLPF on WTO efforts to support achievement of trade-related SDG targets.

"23 September 2019: At the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, 87 companies announced that they will set climate targets across their operations and value chains to align with actions needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels and reach net zero emissions by no later than 2050. The companies are part of the ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C – Our Only Future’ campaign.In July, an initial 28 companiescommitted tothe 1.5°C target in a Call to Action. Since then, the number of companies committing to the target has more than tripled to 87 companies, which have a combined market capitalization of over USD 2.3 trillion and annual direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 73 coal-fired power plants.Many first-movers in the private sector are aligning with civil society and ambitious governments by stepping up in support of a 1.5°C future.To date, AstraZeneca, BT, Burberry Limited, Deutsche Telekom AG, Dexus, Elopak, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intuit, Levi Strauss & Co, SAP, Schneider Electric, Signify, Sodexo, The Co-operative Group and Unilever have already verified 1.5°C-aligned reduction targets covering GHG emissions from their operations. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) independently assesses the corporate emissions reduction targets of companies that have committed to the Campaign. All 87 signatories have committed to apply these reductions across their entire value chains, which represents an emissions reduction target that is 5.5 times higher than a target for their operations, on average.UN Secretary-General António Guterres said it is “encouraging to see many first-movers in the private sector align with civil society and ambitious governments by stepping up in support of a 1.5°C future.” He called on more companies to “join the movement” and “send a clear signal that markets are shifting.” UN Global Compact (UNGC) Executive Director, Lise Kingo, welcomed the companies’ actions, saying they are “leading the way towards a positive tipping point where 1.5°C-aligned corporate strategies are the new normal for businesses and their supply chains around the world.” She highlighted this type of action as the type of transformative change needed to deliver on the SDGs.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a policy brief and accompanying technical brief on eliminating lead paint and ways for countries to take action.The briefs, titled ‘Global elimination of lead paint: why and how countries should take action,’ describe lead’s toxic effects on human health, especially for children and pregnant women. The policy brief explains that as paint ages, it begins to crumble and flake, releasing lead into household dust. In addition, lead paint removal by abrasive methods or by charring or burning releases lead dust, particles, and fumes. Children ingest lead-contaminated dust through hand-to-mouth behavior, and may also suck and chew on lead-containing or lead-coated objects, including toys and furniture, and eat lead paint flakes. Workers are also exposed to lead and may bring lead dust home on their clothing.Dealing with legacy lead paint has an estimated cost of USD 1.2-11 billion in the US alone.The authors maintain that legally binding regulatory measures prohibiting lead in paint are key to preventing exposure. Thepolicy briefsummarizes information on the background and rationale for eliminating lead paint and action countries can take, with more detailed information provided in thetechnical brief.The policy brief notes that while international efforts to eliminate lead paint have increased, the need remains for more legally binding control measures. It explains that lead paint laws create incentives for change by encouraging: paint manufacturers to reformulate their paints; ingredient suppliers to produce more and better non-lead ingredients; and paint importers and distributors to sell paints that comply with the laws. The brief also argues that a strong law creates a fair competitive market for paint manufacturers, importers, and exporters, and harmonized lead paint laws among countries can reduce trade barriers.Eliminating lead paint, according to the brief, prevents losses due to reduced productivity and avoids costs of health impacts and of dealing with legacy lead paint. For example, dealing with legacy paint has an estimated cost of between USD 1.2 billion and USD 11 billion in the US. While some initial investment costs are necessary to reformulate paint, many manufacturers, including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have already reformulated their products, viewing it as part of their corporate social responsibility.To develop a lead paint law, the policy brief underscores the need for stakeholder engagement to gain support, and awareness-raising to promote the law’s development and implementation. The Lead Paint Alliance has developed guidance materials and tools to help countries establish lead paint laws, including aModel Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint.The briefs were published ahead ofInternational Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, which takes place from 25-31 October 2020.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Yet the latest research suggests that moving to best available technologies (BAT) would reduce cumulative emissions from the sector by 38-60 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2030 and up to 130-260 GtCO2e by 2050.Catalyzed by the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Programme, the ‘Cool Coalition,’ which works to expand access to cooling while reducing the climate impact of the cooling industry, received the following pledges:26 countries, including Bangladesh and the Philippines, undertake to adopt comprehensive national cooling plans;Led by France, several countries commit to the ‘Biarritz Pledge for Fast Action on Efficient Cooling’;Five countries (the Dominican Republic, North Macedonia, Rwanda, Senegal and Spain) commit to integrate cooling in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs);Andorra, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark, Djibouti, Hungary, Japan, Lebanon, Norway and the UK are among the countries making additional cooling-related pledges;The World Bank Group and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) are integrating clean and efficient cooling across their lending and investment portfolios;The Children’s Investment Future Fund (CIFF) pledges an additional USD 20 million in funding for cooling, bringing Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program (K-CEP) funding to over USD 60 million;C40 cities, including Copenhagen, Medellin and Barcelona, undertake to work with their network of more than 90 member cities to share expertise and integrate urban cooling into their climate action plans to reduce energy consumption while improving air quality;Pledges from the private sector include Electrolux and Mabe releasing plans by the end of 2019 to switch to lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants in all of their cooling product lines and Engie’s planned investment of between EUR 1.8 billion and 2 billion in highly efficient District Cooling systems by 2024.[UNEP Press Release] [Climate Action Summit Press Release] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Climate Action Summit] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Energy Efficiency Commitment by ‘Three Percent Club’]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
"28 August 2019: In remarks to the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP18) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), CITES Secretary-General Ivonne Higuero stressed that, “Humanity needs to respond to the growing extinction crisis by transforming the way we manage the world’s wild animals and plants. Business as usual is no longer an option.”CoP18 convened from 17-28 August 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland. It took place fewer than four months after the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its landmark Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which warned that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history, and that the rate of species extinctions is accelerating with grave impacts on people around the world.Earth Negotiations Bulletincoverage of CoP18 reports that delegates responded to this crisis, in part, by revising the trade rules for dozens of wildlife species that are threatened by unsustainable trade linked to overharvesting, overfishing, or overhunting.CoP18 delegates addressed 57 proposals to increase or decrease controls on international trade in wildlife and wildlife products, submitted by 90 parties. In addition, 140 documents proposing new measures and policies on international trade in wild fauna and flora were submitted for consideration by the Conference.Among the issues addressed, in response to demand for African teak from western Africa, CoP18 considered the need for trade permits to include plywood and other forms. Delegates agreed to protections for the Mulanje cedar, and mukula tree, which were added to Appendix II, indicating they may become endangered if their trade is not regulated. All Latin American species of cedar were also listed in Appendix II.CoP18 added 18 shark species to Appendix II, including blacknose and sharpnose guitarfishes, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and wedgefishes. The CoP also addressed other marine species, including eels, teatfish (sea cucumber), queen conch, marine turtles, precious corals, sturgeons, and seahorses. In response to the increasing exotic pet trade, many species of turtle, lizard, and gecko were granted protections. CoP18 also established the CITES Big Cat Task Force with a mandate to improve enforcement, tackle illegal trade and promote collaboration on conserving tigers, lions, cheetahs, jaguars and leopards. CoP18 rejected proposals to permit some limited trade in ivory from African elephants.CoP18 closed with the adoption of the CITES Strategic Vision Post-2020, which seeks to position CITES as a leader in promoting transformative change, environmental, economic and social sustainability, and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Furthermore, the role of local and indigenous communities that live on the frontlines of wildlife conservation and sustainable management, and their need for adequate incomes and livelihoods, was widely recognized.CoP19 will be held in 2022 in Costa Rica.

"19 July 2019: The UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Léo Heller, has proposed a framework for managing and monitoring the impacts of large-scale projects on local populations’ access to potable water and sanitation.His report to the UN General Assembly outlines seven typical stages in the life-cycle of a large-scale “mega-project,” cites examples of impacts from existing projects, including mines, dams, and plantations, and provides questions for duty bearers at each stage, based on existing human rights norms and principles. The report highlights gaps in the existing regulatory framework on mega-projects and a lack of adequate safeguards in implementation.Titled the ‘Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation‘ (A/74/197), the report recognizes seven stages in a mega-project: macro-planning; licensing or approval; planning and design; construction; short-term operation; long-term operation; decommissioning and disaster management.The report recommends that mega-projects avoid impeding physical access to water sources or sanitation facilities and provide alternative services if needed. It calls for identifying affected populations, consulting them in good faith, and initiating projects only with free, prior and informed content (FPIC) of the affected population. Where there are negative impacts, the report calls for redress and reparation measures to be provided in an appropriate and timely manner.Among the gaps noted are the frequent lack of regulation for mega-projects to include a decommissioning stage, although project impacts can continue long into the future.The Special Rapporteur’s report was developed through a consultation process with UN Member States, civil society organizations and businesses. It included written submissions from 33 entities, one public consultation, and two expert consultations in Malaysia and Morocco.Heller notes that mega-projects are often thought to be needed for meeting different SDG targets, including investment in the ‘infrastructure gap.” He argues that capital investors often create increased incentives for States to implement mega-projects and to disregard the concomitant need for human rights protection against impacts such as water pollution and water scarcity due to retention or overuse of water by upstream actors. He adds that human rights defenders who have advocated for the rights of those affected by mega-projects have in the past been harassed, assaulted or even murdered.Heller has served as Special Rapporteur since late 2014.

"Lessons from previous pandemics and disasters can provide guidance for safeguards to apply when funding COVID-19 pandemic responses. The lessons are presented in a paper titled, ‘Accountability in a Time of Crisis’ released in April 2020.The paper was developed by the INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI), Audit Service Sierra Leone (ASSL), General Auditing Commission of Liberia (GAC), and African Organisation of French-speaking Supreme Audit Institutions (CREFIAF).Emergency situations can lead to basic control systems being suspended or bypassed.The introduction to the paper notes that “emergency situations can lead to basic control systems being suspended or bypassed, combined with weakening of accountability systems and oversight.” The rush to address a crisis may result in increased levels of waste, mismanagement, and corruption, they caution.The paper draws from audits of previous crises, including the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, to identify lessons that can be used for handling the coronavirus crisis. The paper presents recommendations for the role that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) could play in the crisis and safeguards that development partners could apply when funding COVID-19 measures.Among the activities that SAIs can provide during a pandemic are:provide advice on rules and regulations;conduct real-time audits on procurement;audit the implementation of new regulations and programmes;maintain dialogue with stakeholders such as the government, development partners, and CSOs to understand the COVID-19 response, the main risks, and how the SAI can add value through its audit work; andundertake short, special audit reports in order to issue timely and relevant reports outside the normal audit cycle.In the aftermath of a crisis, the paper recommends that SAI audits be used for accountability purposes as well as to identify lessons for the future.The paper also suggests that development partners can reinforce good governance practices and carefully select short-term safeguards while encouraging the adoption of medium-term safeguards. Recommendations for how development partners can achieve these objectives include:produce immediate messaging to strengthen and reinforce behaviors:encourage key national stakeholders and other implementing agencies to send clear messages setting expectations about the use of and accountability for emergency funds;in the short-term, use appropriate safeguards relevant for different sector risks and funding modalities; andin the medium-term, encourage governments to take action on relevant prior audit reports, bringing key findings and recommendations into policy dialogue, and encourage SAIs to stay visible and conduct follow-up audits on implementation of prior recommendations.The paper recommends that development partners should ensure that SAIs can audit the use of emergency funds. The authors suggest that development partners should consider how funds will be audited at the outset rather than after funds have been spent.

"6 August 2019: The World Resources Institute (WRI) has updated its Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, which presents information about countries’ respective levels of water risk. The Atlas also provides web-based tools that can map water risks such as floods, droughts and stress, based on 13 indicators such as groundwater availability.TheAqueduct Toolson the Atlas website use open-source, peer-reviewed data to derive their rankings of water stress.The Atlas identifies 17 countries with extremely high water stress, where up to 80% of available water resources, including groundwater, is being used up every year. It shows that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has the world’s highest level of water risk. Qatar emerges as the country with the highest level of water risk, followed by Lebanon and then Israel. India, one of the world’s most populous countries, is ranked 13th globally for water risk.The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and web tools were developed by WRI’s research partners and an alliance of companies, governments, and foundations working with WRI to improve sustainable water management. They are relevant to monitoring progress on SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) targets, including target 6.4 on ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity by 2030, and target 6.6 on protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, including rivers, aquifers and lakes by 2020.Further information on water risk in agriculture and food security, and on flood risk in coastal zones is forthcoming.

"The lack of variety and increasing uniformity of crops may render food systems unsustainable, a new set of conservation guidelines by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) warns. Titled, ‘Voluntary Guidelines for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Farmers Varieties,’ the publication highlights how crop genetic diversity enables resistance to environmental, climactic and other shocks.Launched at theEighth Session of the Governing Body of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture(ITPGR) on 14 November, the Guidelines serve as a tool for development practitioners, researchers, students and policymakers. They offer a systematic approach to on-farm activities to conserve crop genetic resources, and they complement the ‘Voluntary Guidelines for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Crop Wild Relatives and Wild Food Plants,’ published in 2018. The Guidelines also align with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) target 2.5, which calls for, by 2020, maintaining the genetic diversity of seeds and cultivated plants and their related wild species.FAO notes that almost all countries report the “genetic erosion” of crops, with maize, wheat and rice accounting for 51% of all plant-based food. It underscores that the loss of crop genetic diversity poses a “particularly severe” threat to global food security and nutrition – one that risks the achievement of SDG 2 on eradicating hunger and malnutrition by 2030. The Guidelines’ Foreword points out that, “for our food systems to be sustainable, farmers must, therefore, grow the most genetically diverse set of crops and varieties that are suited to their agroecologies, production systems and end-users’ preferences.”The Guidelines also recommend documenting existing plant genetic resources for agriculture and mapping plant genetic resources’ actual and potential uses. They call for retaining genetic resources as well as providing farmers and local communities with information and support in relation to crop conservation and sustainable use, bearing in mind different countries and contexts. Overall, the publication offers guidance that countries can employ, especially in the development of ‘National Plans for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Farmers’ Varieties/Landraces.’ [UN Press Release] [FAO Press Release] [Publication: ‘Voluntary Guidelines for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Farmers Varieties’]",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is developing an evaluation methodology to score infrastructure projects against the SDGs to help determine whether governments, the private sector, and civil society are resilient enough for such challenges as the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has led many to question whether the current infrastructure is prepared to provide acute healthcare and other critical services.The People-first Project Impact Assessment Tool will enable the evaluation and testing of the quality of infrastructure and public services, including public-private partnerships (PPPs), and the assessment by governments of new infrastructure project resilience. During a virtual meeting on 23 March 2020, UNECE’s Project Team agreed to integrate resilience criteria into the Tool.The Project Team, comprised of over 100 experts from public and private sectors, academia, and NGOs, was established in January 2020. The Team is working across five areas to define benchmarks or evaluation criteria and a scoring system for people-first outcomes. The five areas being addressed are: access and equity, economic effectiveness, environmental sustainability and resilience, replicability, and stakeholder engagement. The Team is also expected to develop an implementation system to provide a cost-free mechanism through which governments can receive a score for their projects.The evaluation methodology and implementation system is being undertaken as part of the UNECE’s ‘People-first’ approach to PPPs, through theUNECE’s Committee on Innovation, Competitiveness and PPPs, to make the PPP model fit for purpose for the SDGs.The Tool aims to be user-friendly for all relevant stakeholders, and applicable to all PPP sectors and project categories, and publicly-owned and PPP projects. A multi-stakeholder consultation process and collaborative efforts are contributing to the design of the Tool to better ensure effective implementation and broad adoption.

"19 August 2019: The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is proposing a set of principles for protecting freshwater sources, as a basis for promoting resilience and adaptation to climate change. In its ‘Wellspring’ report, the organization warns that current water resource management approaches still focus on “gray solutions” such as dams, reservoirs, and pipes, rather than investing in ecosystems.The report puts forward alternatives to traditional conservation practices and recommends principles for adapting to an uncertain climate future.The 62-page report, titled ‘Wellspring: Source Water Resilience and Climate Adaptation,’ argues that conventional approaches, such as defining targets based on a past ecological baseline, may be counter-productive in the context of a “new normal,” given that climactic conditions may have changed irretrievably.The authors argue instead for applying management principles that will promote the resilience of freshwater ecosystems, referred to as source water protection (SWP). These include: seeking to manage and maintain hydrologic connectivity; avoiding distortions of the natural flow regime; allowing for spatial variation within freshwater ecosystems, for example, allowing rivers to meander rather than be channeled; and managing freshwater ecosystems at the basin scale, based on effective governance and a shared vision.They report identifies activities for protecting freshwater sources in view of the types of climate change impacts they can help address. Land restoration and re-vegetation, including protection of forests, wetlands and grasslands, rank high in terms of climate benefits. Other activities include restoration of riparian zones, sustainable agricultural practices, good practices in ranching activities, fire risk management and roads management. Many of the actions proposed support implementation of SDG target 6.6 on protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes, as well as targets under SDG 15 on terrestrial ecosystems.The report draws on experiences from the Chile, Mexico, Rwanda and the US to develop recommendations for: treating water as a “non-stationary asset” that may represent a shifting baseline; considering upstream-downstream and surface-groundwater interactions to assess and reduce climate-related risks; strengthening existing financing, management and stakeholder institutions through relationships and incentives for adaptive, flexible management; and “welcoming ecosystems into the water management circle” through integrating communities and nature into a common management framework.The report was published byTNCin collaboration with theGlobal Resilience Partnership (GRP)and theAlliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA).

"23 July 2019: Companies are calling on governments to match their commitment to set climate targets aligned with limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels and a net zero future ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019.Twenty-eight companies with a total market capitalization of USD 1.3 trillion have committed to increase their ambition in response to the ‘Business Ambition for 1.5°C’ campaign through more aggressive climate targets aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels and reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The call to action was issued in June in an open letter addressed to business leaders and signed by 25 global leaders, including UN General Assembly (UNGA) President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, UN Global Compact CEO and Executive Director Lise Kingo, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and Global Optimism Co-Founder Christiana Figueres.By sending strong market signals, the companies are showing governments that they must ramp up ambition in their NDCs.The 28 companies collectively represent over one million employees from 17 sectors and more than 16 countries. Of the 28 companies, AstraZeneca, BT, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Levi Strauss & Co., SAP, Signify and Unilever already have 1.5°C-aligned reduction targets that cover emissions from their operations.UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Climate Action Summit, Luis Alfonso de Alba, said that by sending strong market signals, the companies are showing governments that they must ramp up ambition in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In turn, by setting policies and targets in line with a 1.5°C trajectory, governments give businesses the clarity and confidence they require to invest in the zero-carbon economies.The companies will set targets through theScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which mobilizes companies to set science-based targets and increase their competitive advantage in transitioning to the low-carbon economy and assesses corporate emission reduction targets against the latest climate science. To date, over 600 businesses are setting science-based emission reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change.The CEOs who commit their companies to a 1.5°C target will be recognized at the UN Global Compact’s Private Sector Forum during the UN Climate Action Summit.

"24 August 2019: The 31st UN-Water Meeting discussed progress on and next steps for joint initiatives that UN-Water Members and Partners have undertaken to ensure that the UN is “delivering as one” to address global water challenges.Many of the initiatives discussed during this meeting, which took place in Stockholm, Sweden, from 23-24 August 2019, immediately prior to World Water Week 2019, will contribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, with particular emphasis on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on clean water and sanitation. These include the Integrated Monitoring Initiative (IMI) for SDG 6, which is supported by the custodians of the SDG 6 indicators. Several speakers at the UN-Water meeting said this initiative has resulted in a monitoring approach for SDG 6 that is advanced compared to other SDGs. Participants received a preview of one IMI project, the SDG Data Portal, which will be officially launched on 27 August 2019, during World Water Week.Another initiative discussed at the meeting stemmed from a High Level Panel on Water recommendation that was endorsed at the 29th UN-Water meeting, in August 2018. During discussions on the agenda item on the process leading to the 2021 and 2023 UN high-level meetings mandated in the midterm review resolution on the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development,” 2018–2028, participants highlighted the value that these two meetings could have for water and sanitation policy if their preparations and objectives are properly pursued.Participants discussed ideas to include in a roadmap for the UN-Water Strategy to 2030.Additional agenda items addressed global events that are expected to shape water policy opportunities in the coming decade, including the UN reform process and increased attention to the water, peace, and security nexus. Delegates discussed what UN-Water could offer for country-level engagement in the context of UN reform, which has changed the way that the UN works with countries. A panel discussion considered how to situate water in climate change processes, and participants conducted an initial discussion on ideas to include in a roadmap for the UN-Water Strategy to 2030.UN-Water Meetings bring Members and Partners together twice a year to carry out the mandate of informing policies, monitoring and reporting, and inspiring action on water and sanitation issues.

"The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) has launched, for consultation, a draft investor guide that seeks to provide a practical blueprint to enable investors to align with and more fully contribute to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.The IIGCC developed the ‘Net Zero Investment Framework’ with over 70 leading global investors representing an aggregate of over USD 16 trillion in assets. The guide is intended to enable investors to adopt a strategy to decarbonize their investment portfolios while increasing investment in climate solutions to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050.The Framework is “based on the expectation that governments and policy makers will deliver on commitments to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.” The IIGCC designed the Framework to help deliver “additional meaningful long-term emission reductions,” overcoming limitations in other approaches “based only on portfolio emissions reduction or portfolio temperature targets,” which allow investors to “technically meet targets while selling the problem to someone else.”The Framework provides a comprehensive set of recommended actions, metrics, and methodologies to enable both asset owners and managers to become “net zero investors.” It covers four asset classes: sovereign bonds; listed equities; corporate fixed income; and real estate, with other asset classes to follow. The Framework identifies five core components of a net zero investment strategy: governance and strategy; objectives and targets; strategic asset allocation; asset class alignment; and policy advocacy and market engagement.The Framework isopen for consultationuntil 25 September 2020. Five investors – APG, Brunel, the Church of England Pensions Board, PKA, and Phoenix Group – are testing the Framework by modeling its impact across the performance of their portfolios, collectively valued at USD 1.3 trillion. Results of this analysis will be included in the final Framework, expected to be released later in 2020.The IIGCC is a European membership body for collaboration on climate change. The organization includes over 240 members, mostly pension funds and asset managers, across fifteen countries, representing over EUR 33 trillion in assets under management. The Framework is a key output of the IIGCC’sParis Aligned Investing Initiative(PAII), which was established at the request of European asset owners to develop key definitions and concepts relating to the alignment of investment strategies to the Paris Agreement. [Publication:Net Zero Investment Framework for Consultation] [IGCC Press Release]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

"24 October 2019: The UN Secretariat has announced it is organizing a public consultation to generate a global vision for the year 2045, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the UN. The process aims to improve international institutions to meet the aspirations reflected in the 2030 Agenda and bolster the environment for international cooperation.Beginning in January 2020, the UN will convene dialogues around the world with “all segments and generations of society,” with a particular focus on listening to youth and marginalized groups. Discussion moderators will utilize a one-minute survey methodology to create a digital feedback loop. Other methodologies for the consultation include a global scientific survey conducted with the Pew Foundation, and artificial intelligence (AI) “sentiment analysis” of social media feeds. Global Pulse and other partners in the UN system will help with processing the input.Rather than changing public opinion, “we should be letting public opinion change us.”The views and ideas resulting from the dialogues will be presented to world leaders and senior UN officials at a high-profile event on 21 September 2020, when the UN will mark the 75th anniversary of its establishment.Fabrizio Hochschild, UN Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary,briefed reporterson the “UNat75” process on 24 October 2019 – which also marked UN Day. Hochschild said the consultation will focus on three areas:Defining the future we want, looking towards 2045;Identifying global megatrends leading the world away from that vision; andIdeas for improving global cooperation.Hochschild said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres does not see the upcoming anniversary as a moment for celebration, but an impetus to address an unfolding “retreat” from international cooperation and the institutions set up to foster it. Therefore, the UN is holding a conversation, “not one that idealizes our current institutions” but a process to make international cooperation function better. This course correction would focus on gaps between where we are headed if current megatrends continue, and the global aspirations for a better future as reflected in the 2030 Agenda.The views collected will feed into Guterres’ presentation to UN Member States at the anniversary commemoration in September 2020. It will take the form of user-friendly material including a report, films, and broadcast materials aimed at reaching leaders across the world, said Hochschild.TheUNat75 websiteincludes “issue pieces” to spur debate on the key megatrends (climate crisis, inequality, new forms of conflict and violence, rapid changes in demography and digital technologies), a series of videos, and other resources.Asked what should be done to change public opinion in countries where there is low confidence in the UN, Hochschild said that rather than changing public opinion, “we should be letting public opinion change us.” The consultation process is a tool for determining how the UN can and should improve, by gathering critical voices and meet their aspirations, in order to renew current institutions.

"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has developed a guidance tool to measure the contribution of the private sector to the SDGs, using 33 SDG indicators. The toolkit is also expected to help raise awareness on the importance of reporting contributions to the SDGs, as called for in SDG target 12.6.UNCTAD developed the tool through a three-year consultation process under the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR). The 36th session of ISAR, which convened from 30 October to 1 November 2019, endorsed the guidance tool. The toolkit is based on key reporting principles and frameworks and companies’ reporting practices.The guidance can help incorporate the private sector’s contributions to SDG implementation into VNRs.The ‘Guidance on core indicators for entity reporting on contribution towards implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals’ features 33 core SDG indicators on economic, environmental, institutional and social areas, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and chemicals, the use of energy and water, waste generation and recycling, gender equality, community development and human resource management. The tool aims to help companies track and report their impacts and progress on SDG targets using comparable and reliable quantitative information. In addition, the tool aims to help governments design policies and develop institutional mechanisms to collect data from companies’ reports to reflect the private sector’s contribution to the SDGs, in line with SDG indicator 12.6.1 (number of companies publishing sustainability reports).In a press release, James Zhan, UNCTAD, emphasized the tool’s potential to promote better coherence between financial and sustainability reporting. Noting that the diversity of reporting frameworks has presented a challenge for government agencies and investors interested in monitoring SDG implementation at the national level, Zhan said the guidance on core indicators for SDG reporting will help harmonize sustainability reporting, and can help incorporate the private sector’s contribution to SDG implementation into voluntary national reviews (VNRs).According to UNCTAD, it has validated the toolkit in China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Guatemala, Kenya, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine. Guatemala’s government agency that promotes small and medium enterprise (SME) development plans will conduct training sessions on SDG reporting for 20-25 companies to help them learn to apply the toolkit. UNCTAD is implementing a capacity-building project in Brazil, Colombia, Kenya and South Africa to strengthen government capacity to measure and monitor the contribution of the private sector to the SDGs. UNCTAD also plans to incorporate the toolkit’s core indicators into a software that will be used to collect sustainability information across Central America from 2020.

"19 July 2019: Nobel laureates and leading personalities from science, business and culture urged public and private actors to adopt “immediately effective measures” to counteract the deterioration of the health of the oceans in a Declaration.In the 2019 Rei Jaume I Awards Jury Declaration (PRJI), 19 Nobel laureates and personalities outline threats facing the world’s oceans. They recognize that the oceans face threats from marine pollution and the growing use of plastics, overfishing, the presence of hazardous waste and pesticides, and marine transportation. The members of the juries of the PRJI further observe that these threats have become “immediate threats to the health of the oceans,” and contribute to pollutants entering the human food chain, threatening human health. They express additional concern about the impact of global warming, the increase of the average temperature of ocean waters, the intensity of meteorological phenomena on the coasts and air pollution, underscoring these threats as a “serious threat to wildlife and flora of the oceans.”Within this context, the members of the juries of the PRJI, urge “all public and private actors” to immediately adopt measures to counteract these threats and preserve the ocean’s natural heritage for future generations. The members recognize the UN Decade of Oceanic Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ‘Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate’ (SROCC), which is expected to be released in September 2019, as key frameworks for mobilizing action towards a more sustainable and resilient ocean.The Government of Valencia and the Valencian Foundation for Advanced Studies (FVEA) present the Rei Jaume I Awards annually to six researchers for their contributions in the areas of Economics, Environmental Protection, General Research, Medical Research, New Technologies and Urban Studies.

"A platform from Japan’s Ministry of Environment seeks to support efforts to address two global crises: the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. The ‘Platform for Redesign 2020’ is supported by the UNFCCC Secretariat and managed by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES).ThePlatform for Redesign 2020brings together information on countries’ policies and actions being taken in the wake of the global pandemic. It identifies climate mitigation measures, climate adaptation measures, cross-cutting measures, and other environmental measures.As of 25 August 2020, the platform lists the measures that 26 countries have taken. The measures are organized by country and are tagged according to whether the measure relates to one of three categories: response, recovery, or redesign, defined as follows:Response: Short-term emergency measures that address concerns that emerged as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic;Recovery: Socioeconomic measures that address medium-term objectives. These measures include an environmental or climate focus to “build back better” from COVID-19.Redesign: Measures taken with a long-term perspective and seeking to prompt paradigm shifts. They focus on “redesigning current socioeconomic and sociocultural systems to be sustainable and resilient.”For example, a climate mitigation action in Sweden categorized as a response, recovery, and redesign measure involves a decision by which the government will invest in night trains to Europe. This measure will provide greater opportunities for low-carbon travel using public transport. In another example, Chile has announced energy efficiency measures, which the Platform for Redesign 2020 categorizes as both a response and recovery measure.IGESreportsthat the platform will be updated with a view to maintaining and enhancing global momentum toward the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26), which is expected to take place in November 2021.The platform also provides details on anonline ministerial meetingtaking place 3 September 2020. During this event, ministers and high-level officials of UNFCCC Parties will exchange views on climate policies and other environmental measures relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic.Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, Japan, introduced the idea of the platform during the11th Petersberg Climate Dialoguein April 2020 and theJune Momentumorganized by the UNFCCC Secretariat in June 2020.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1

"A widespread shift to digital finance could provide the means to meet the costs of achieving the 2030 Agenda, according to a UN task force. A group of technology and finance leaders, development experts, and government and UN officials launched a report on using financial technology and digital finance to advance sustainable development, focusing on empowering citizens to better align their money with their needs.The Task Force on Digital Financing of the SDGs was established by the UN Secretary-General in 2018, as part of afour-year strategyon financing the 2030 Agenda, and as a complement to theHigh-level Panel on Digital Cooperation. The 17-member Task Force is led by Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, and Maria Ramos, ABSA Group’s former CEO.Citizens need to have a say over where their pension contributions go.The Task Force launched its report titled, ‘People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future,’ on 26 August 2020. It lays out a five-part Action Agenda to “empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs,” which are collectively expressed in the SDGs. These five catalysts are:Aligning the “vast pools” flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs;Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance;Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance;Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs; andAccelerating “lifeblood financing” for small and medium-sized businesses.At the virtual launch of the report, Steiner said “the Task Force was keen to bring back the notion that the citizen is at the center of the economy. Citizens need greater transparency, and to have a say over where their pension contributions go,” as well as to see public benefits from their contributions. He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the popularity and adoption of digital tools, such as digital cash transfers, connecting schools to broadband, and remotely connecting people to government and parliamentary processes. In addition, the widespread adoption of smartphones enables people to manage their finances more actively. He suggested that the financial system could be remodeled to reflect the role of citizens’ pensions and savings in global investment flows.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterressaidthat among all of the Task Force’s findings, “what has truly drawn my attention is the conclusion that digitalization will make a difference by giving people greater control over how global finance — their own money — is used,” and that it increases the ability to hold financial institutions accountable. He endorsed the Task Force’s “vision of citizen-centric finance.”Citing the “dislocation” between the commitment to the SDGs and decision-making around public financing, Guterres said the report provides a set of ideas to “deliver financing for the Sustainable Development Goals, by shifting the center of gravity of the financial system towards empowered citizens.” [Publication:People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future] [Task Force website] [UN News story] [UNDP press release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Chile, in its role as the Presidency of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC, launched the Platform for Science-Based Ocean Solutions (PSBOS). The Platform aims to promote the necessity of addressing ocean and climate issues synergistically and to encourage the incorporation of the ocean in country climate commitments and strategies.The Platform concept note outlines the impacts of climate change on the ocean, and highlights potential marine nature-based solutions. The concept note highlights the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate(SROCC), which warned that the climate impacts on the ocean “are already significant and will be increasingly dangerous” without urgent mitigation and adaptation actions.The concept note further states that through the ‘Because the Ocean’ Declaration, Chile and many other countries have promoted the inclusion of ocean solutions as part of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Within this context, Chile is promoting COP 25 as an opportunity to raise awareness on the importance of including an ocean component in climate action, declaring COP 25 as the ‘Blue COP.’This is the first time we’ve positioned the study, protection and sustainable management of oceans within a major climate action conference.COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt, Minister of Environment, Chile, announced the Platform at a high-level event on the margins of the conference, on 3 December 2019. She said Chile has “named COP 25 the ‘Blue COP’ because for the first time we’ve positioned the study, protection and sustainable management of oceans within a major climate action conference.” She said the Platform aims to be a dynamic space that brings together key methodologies and tools to incorporate oceans into countries’ NDCs and other climate policies.The Platform will encourage and guide implementation of policies, programmes and projects to support evidence on climate change and its impact on the ocean, and will support the creation of a community of practice to share lessons learned, offer inspiration to support the transfer and uptake of solutions in other contexts and advance ocean-climate action. The Platform also seeks to engage a large number of actors in ocean-climate action, including the public and private sectors, civil society and academia.COP 25 will feature several additional discussions and events on the importance of protecting the ocean. The Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP) has facilitated a group of experts who are consolidating knowledge and learning on climate change and ocean linkages into a scoping paper that will identify knowledge gaps and needed actions. The paper will be presented at an interactive Focal Point Forum on 6 December, which aims to encourage the co-design of climate-ocean actions and mobilize support for implementing identified actions in 2020.

"Future Earth and The Earth League, international organizations representing networks of global sustainability scientists, have issued a guide for climate negotiators, policymakers and the media that considers the latest findings in climate science at a time when increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are unprecedented and weather extremes have become the “new normal.”The guide titled, ‘10 New Insights in Climate Science,’ was presented during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain. It summarizes recent Earth-system science, policy, public health and economic research that aims to help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.During the guide’s launch, report co-author Johan Rockström, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, explained that Earth observations show that big systems with known tipping points are already now at 1°C warming and moving towards potentially irreversible change, such as accelerated melting of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, rainforest drying and Arctic permafrost thawing.The ten insights presented in the report are:The world is not on track to cut emissions as agreed under the Paris Agreement;Climate change is happening faster and stronger than expected, with severe implications for food security;Climate change “leaves no mountain summit behind,” with,inter alia, changes to glaciers, snow and ice in mountains likely influencing water availability for over a billion people downstream by mid-century, and irreversible impacts on mountain ecosystems and their biodiversity;Forests are under threat, with climate change exacerbating forest fires, and carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization increasingly being offset by temperature rises that can increase tree mortality;Weather extremes have become the “new normal” in 2019, with societies often lacking sufficient time to fully recover before another event hits;Biodiversity is being threatened, with at least 99% of coral reefs potentially disappearing due to ocean acidification, heatwaves and other pressures at 2°C warming, and freshwater fish die-offs potentially doubling by 2050 due to extreme summer temperatures;Climate change threatens food security and the health of hundreds of millions, with increasing CO2 concentrations reducing the nutritional quality of most cereal crops, and global fish stocks set to further decline;The most vulnerable and poor are the hardest hit by climate change, which, unabated, will hinder progress in developing countries, and failure to mitigate and adapt could push 100 million people below the poverty line by 2030;Equity and equality are pivotal to successful mitigation and adaptation, with social justice highlighted as an important factor for resilience and local and global cooperation; and“Time may have come” for social tipping points on climate action, with an increasing number of citizens concerned about climate change, and deep and long-term transformations required to achieve the Paris Agreement and the SDGs.This is the third annual publication by The Earth League, and Future Earth, which is governed by the International Science Council (ISC), Belmont Forum of funding agencies, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN University (UNU), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum. [Publication:10 New Insights in Climate Science: 2019] [Key Conclusions from the Report] [UNFCCC Press Release]",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
"28 June 2019: The third meeting of the Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA), which is convened by the EU, Canada and China, focused on the opportunities and challenges of transitioning to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies, and on the UNFCCC negotiations agenda.The Ministerial took place in Brussels, Belgium, on 28 June 2019, and was hosted by the EU.Ministers and representatives from 31 governments from all regions and from many of the world’s largest economies came together with representatives from business, industry, the financial sector, development and expert agencies and civil society to discuss ways to accelerate global efforts to implement the commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change.Ministers welcomed the outcome of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC as “an important victory for multilateralism and a clear signal in support for the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement,” and expressed support to the incoming Chilean Presidency in achieving “robust outcomes” at COP 25, including “robust guidance on international carbon markets that ensures environmental integrity and prevents double-counting” to encourage private sector participation.Bilateral and international cooperation will continue to help actors learn from each other, mobilize resources, and achieve concrete results.Among other issues, ministers underlined the importance of concluding the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts and of furthering progress on operational details for the enhanced transparency framework.Ministers welcomed the “political shift in focus from negotiations towards implementation and raising ambition,” and highlighted “the role of all governments in implementing their Paris commitments and in enhancing ambition on mitigation, adaptation and support.” Noting the central role of domestic stakeholders in bringing about transformative action, ministers underscored that bilateral and international cooperation “will continue to help actors learn from each other, mobilize resources, and achieve concrete results.”Emphasizing the importance of finance, capacity building and technological support to developing countries, ministers noted that, in addition to public finance, increasing private sector investment will be necessary to enable the transition to low-carbon and resilient economies and to accelerate innovation, deploy new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhance resilience.Ministers and other participants welcomed the Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit as a “pivotal moment for maintaining the political momentum towards ambition” requiring a long-term vision that is “inclusive, responds to the urgency highlighted by science and addresses the challenges of climate action, economic growth and social development in a mutually supportive manner.”Ministers also emphasized the “pressing need” to respond to the call from youth, citizens and communities from around the world to maintain the global momentum on climate change.

"The SDGs provide a framework for addressing multiple priorities simultaneously. To support policy makers’ efforts to understand the trade-offs among the 17 Goals as they develop implementation plans, a number of organizations have developed tools for assessing synergies and the implications of each policy choice.Through itsPolicy Priority Inference(PPI) project, the Alan Turing Institute, in collaboration with the UN Development Programme (UNDP), is bringing together ideas and methods from computational social sciences in order to help governments understand what policy areas they should prioritize as they design policies to implement the SDGs. The project, announced on 27 May 2020, will model the “socioeconomic mechanisms of the policy-making process through agent-computing simulation and complex networks.” UNDPreportsthat this tool incorporates a “mix of economic theory, behavioral economics, network science, and agent-based modeling.”This tool can be used to:estimate the relative importance that governments assigned to specific policy issues during a specific time period;identify the policy priorities that governments need to set in order to achieve a specific development strategy;measure how resilient a development strategy will be to shocks or crises that require a government to reorganize its priorities; andreview complementarities among policy priorities adopted by different regions at the sub-national level.This budgeting tool can be used to answer questions related to how long it will take to reach the SDGs, how governments can reallocate their public expenditure to speed implementation, and which synergies among SDGs should be promoted.

"3 October 2019: UN Secretary-General António Guterres has written an opinion piece warning that while some understand the climate crisis through data, those suffering its impacts “can simply look out the window” and see them firsthand. Guterres notes that the Climate Action Summit aimed to “serve as a springboard” to ensure that countries are on track ahead of the 2020 deadline to increase ambition established by the Paris Agreement on climate change.Guterres highlights that at theSummit:more than 70 countries and 100 cities committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050;at least 70 countries announced their intention to ramp up ambition in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2020;small island developing States (SIDS) togethercommittedto achieve carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030;many countries, including Pakistan, Guatemala, Colombia, Nigeria, New Zealand and Barbados, vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees;more than 100 private sector leaders committed to accelerating the transition to a green economy;the International Development Finance Club pledged tomobilizeUSD 1 trillion in clean energy funding by 2025 in 20 least developed countries (LDCs);one-third of the global banking sectorcommitted to aligntheir businesses with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs; anda group of asset owners, responsible for directing more than USD 2 trillion,pledgedto move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050.The Secretary-General notes that the Summit also showcased: ways in which cities and global industries likeshippingcan achieve emission reductions; and initiatives toprotect forestsand water supplies.While lauding all these commitments and the fact that young people, the UN and a growing number of leaders are mobilizing, Guterres says more still needs to be done. He calls for: “heeding the call of science”; reducing emissions by 45% by 2030; achieving carbon neutrality by 2050; and limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century. He says without increased ambition, the end of this century could see a temperature rise of 3°C.The Secretary-General also urges: countries to “kick their addiction” to coal and pursue cheaper, greener options, which are already available; more progress on carbon pricing; ensuring no new coal plants by 2020; and ending fossil fuel subsidies. He calls on developed countries to fulfill their commitment to provide USD 100 billion a year by 2020 to developing countries.Finally, Guterres highlights the Santiago Climate Change Conference in December in Chile as an opportunity to hold those who made commitments during the Climate Action Summit accountable.The op-ed was published in more than 170 news outlets worldwide, following the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019.

"In 2019, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimated that an additional investment of USD 1.5 trillion per year would enable Asia-Pacific developing countries to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Following up on the analytical framework used to develop this estimate, as published in ESCAP’s ‘Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2019: Ambitions beyond Growth,’ the Commission has now published a practical Guidebook to help policy makers and other stakeholders estimate their investment needs for implementing the SDGs.Titled ‘A Guidebook for Assessing SDG Investment Needs,’ the publication is paired with an onlinedashboardon SDG investment trends.The Guidebook seeks to support countries in their implementation of Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs). It recommends that costing SDG implementation should be “viewed as an integral part of effective planning which could also help countries develop an ambitious yet realistic financing strategy.” It further highlights that the “process of identifying interventions to be costed, their intended beneficiaries and the responsible service providers could result in improved policy design and implementation.” This result would occur if, for example, an SDG-related intervention cuts across the mandates of multiple government ministries and agencies and thus requires coordination from multiple actors to clarify responsibilities.The Guidebook notes that costing SDG implementation is different from other costing exercises due to what is being costed. The 2030 Agenda emphasizes universal access and leaving no one behind, which should be reflected in the costing of targets, scenarios and interventions. In addition, SDG costing should consider the interlinkages across the Goals. It notes that some targets do not include numerical outcomes, leaving room for each country to identify what is nationally appropriate.The Guidebook provides a Goal by Goal evaluation of considerations to take into account when costing SDG implementation. [A Guidebook for Assessing SDG Investment Needs]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"During the 39th session of the Executive Body for the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, ministers and high-level representatives of Parties to the Convention approved a declaration to renew their commitment for action on cleaner air in the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region, in line with the Long-term Strategy for the Convention for 2020-2030 and beyond.At a Special Anniversary Session, held from 11-12 December 2019, representatives from over 50 countries,inter alia, acknowledged milestones under the Convention, discussed visions for future development of the Convention, showcased recent developments in their countries, and shared experiences and lessons learned. At the same time, participants recognized that some challenges still exist to implement the Convention, and highlighted the need for further support.The declaration (ECE/EB.AIR/2019/6) recognizes air pollution as the “single greatest environmental risk to human health and one of the main avoidable causes of death and disease globally,” which also affects the economy, ecosystems and climate. It expresses appreciation for the Air Convention’s demonstrated success in providing a regional framework for controlling and reducing the damage to human health and the environment caused by transboundary air pollution through: decoupling pollutant emissions and economic growth; substantially reducing emissions of certain air pollutants; and reversing or decelerating acidification in forest soils and lakes.Parties reaffirm their commitment to improving air quality in order to foster a better environment and reduce negative impacts on human health, in light of new challenges that continue to emerge. To address the environmental threats and health problems associated with air pollution, they call for, among other actions:Maximizing the impact of the Air Convention;Ensuring the provision of resources for the effective long-term operation of the Convention’s monitoring, modeling and assessment capabilities;Continuing to focus on the pollutants best controlled at the regional level and considering the need for further action to address remaining and emerging issues;Supporting scientific activities that respond to policy needs and questions, influence priorities and guide decisions;Improving cooperation between different levels of government; andPromoting an integrated approach to environmental policymaking, recognizing that air pollution is the central link in the interaction between ground-level ozone, nitrogen, human health, climate change and ecosystems.Parties also launched the forum for international cooperation on air pollution. This initiative will support international exchange of information and mutual learning on the technical and policy levels, and serve as a repository for technical information and a convener of countries and organizations, facilitating increased international cooperation.Parties also celebrated theentry into force, on 7 October 2019, of the amended Gothenburg Protocol, which regulates emission reductions for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP).

The group called for immediate government action to end overfishing, as a key climate action.Speaking at an event on COP25’s Ocean Day, the UN Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, stressed a healthy ocean ecosystem is critical for a healthy planetary ecosystem. He highlighted SDG 14 (life below water) target 14.4 on ending overfishing by 2020, saying that ending “overfishing is a very achievable target.”  UBC’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, Director of the Fisheries Economics Research Unit, Rashid Sumaila, said the combination of overfishing and climate change “is deadly for fish stocks and marine ecosystems.” He called for holistic, comprehensive solutions to address the ocean and climate crises, stressing that “ending overfishing would strengthen the ocean.”Participants recognized that ending overfishing offers an immediate action that will restore fish populations, increase income and jobs for fishers and coastal communities, deliver more profitable fisheries, create more resilient ecosystems, and decrease carbon dioxide pollution and increase carbon capture.Participants also discussed the European Union’s (EU) fisheries ministers’ commitment to end overfishing, as set out in the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The Policy states that fishing practices should not harm the ability of fish populations to reproduce and recommends 2015 and 2020 catch limits that are “sustainable and maintain fish stocks in the long term.” EU member States are meeting on 16-17 December to discuss issues related to agriculture and fisheries, including setting total allowable catches (TACs) for the Atlantic and North Sea fish stocks.

"A policy brief from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) makes the case for a common definition of sustainable development investment. A shared understanding could help ensure a meaningful contribution to the SDGs and hold companies accountable for the social and environmental behavior, the authors argue.The policy brief released on 28 May 2020 titled, ‘How can investors move from greenwashing to SDG-enabling?,’ observes that companies must help build a sustainable world, which they need in order to preserve their long-term financial performance. However, investors may lack tools to measure activity and hold companies accountable. A common definition of Sustainable Development Investment (SDI) would establish norms and minimum thresholds to qualify as aligned with sustainable development. The authors note that the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliancelaunched in October 2019is working on a shared understanding of sustainable investing.The time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.A common definition would need to be followed by strengthened reporting requirements. Regulatory frameworks would “enable a proper assessment of corporate contribution to the SDGs, but also penalize unsustainable practices and discourage short-term thinking in capital markets.”The brief notes that theFinancing for Sustainable Development Report 2020, prepared by over 60 international agencies from the UN system and beyond, recommended the adoption of global mandatory disclosures on climate-related financial risk like those promoted by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).The authors also identify three challenges to sustainability reporting by companies. First, its voluntary nature: “the time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.” Second, the quality and absence of meaningful KPIs that connect to the SDGs; only 23% of multinational companies’ sustainability reports connect the SDGs to numerical performance indicators, and “without numbers, sustainability reporting quickly becomes a public relations exercise.” Third, the variety in type of information, which makes it hard to compare different companies’ data.Finally, the brief notes that Canada has pioneered an approach in which companies receiving financial assistance for crises like the COVID-19 pandemic must commit to stricter reporting requirements on socioeconomic issues, as well as carbon reduction targets.The brief is part of a series aimed at helping policy makers facing difficult choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The series has also addressed the impacts of the pandemic onyouth,older persons,persons with disabilities, andindigenous peoples, and how it is affecting physical activity and wellbeing; and accountability at the national level and the relationships between States and people, amongother topics.

"The UN Secretariat has launched a toolkit to support public participation in the commemoration of the organization’s 75th anniversary (UN75) in 2020. The toolkit for ‘Forward Looking Conversation to Reimagine our Future’ poses three main questions: (1) What kind of future do people want to create? (2) Is the international community on track to realize that future? and (3) What action is needed to bridge that gap? It is meant to foster discourse within what the UN Secretariat has called “the largest and furthest-reaching global conversation ever on building the future we want.”The toolkit is available on theUN75 website. Within the framework of UN75 campaign, the toolkit is meant to encourage people, ideally in all 193 UN Member States, to think of ways that enhanced international cooperation could bring about a better world by 2045, the UN’s 100th birthday. It also aims to create a common vision and a shared understanding of the threats to that future, as well as of the modalities to address these challenges. The UN75 website also provides issue briefs, a branding package with logos that can be used for the occasion, as well as news and events and responses to frequently asked questions.The toolkit specifies that UN75 will be “a year of listening and learning,” with UN organizations, UN country teams (UNCTs) and stakeholders invited to take three main actions:Connect people by bringing together diverse groups, “especially those not often heard,” to shape a new global dialogue, with UN country offices called to start multi-stakeholder conversations as early as late 2019;Amplify the voice of the people through,inter alia,posting videos on UN75’s social media platform, taking and sharing UN75’s short survey, organizing informal conversations, social media chats, online discussions and formal focus groups; andInspire action, provide feedback, and share and advocate solutions, as a global platform to illustrate key outcomes of discussions is being developed by the UN75 team and the views and ideas will be presented to world leaders and senior UN officials at the high-level meeting of heads of state and government in New York on 21 September 2020, which will be dedicated to UN’s 75th anniversary.The UN75 toolkit also provides several resources to “get the conversation started,” including videos, podcasts, social media tools, branding guidelines, and fact sheets on what have been identified as the most pressing issues to be addressed by the global conversation: new technologies; inequality; the climate crisis; shifting demographics; and a new era of conflict and violence.People can participate in the UN75 Global conversation through: a short online survey; physical and online dialogues held in collaboration with partners; their own dialogues; and an online feedback form to capture the results of dialogue (with the option to provide feedback via partners for those without internet access).

"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) convened an event to discuss the ways in which cutting-edge technological and digital innovations can help meet climate-related targets in the agriculture and forestry sectors.The event titled, ‘Promoting a Digital Revolution to Increase Climate Action in the Agriculture and Forestry Sectors,’ was held during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, on 12 December. It presented the agriculture sector’s potential in advancing Paris Agreement implementation through a technological revolution.Panelists emphasized that reducing emissions while increasing yields in the agriculture sector requires enhancing mitigation, adaptation and resilience, which can all be driven by technology. For example, Alma Cardenas, Senior Programme Manager, Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Earth, Microsoft, said the digital revolution has led to mitigation and adaptation solutions, highlighting,inter alia: sensors in farms to provide real time information on soil conditions; weather forecast algorithms to provide guidance on when to sow or harvest; and drones that collect information for digital mapping to guide irrigation or fertilization.René Castro, Assistant Director-General, FAO, announced that FAO has finalized the first digital land restoration map for Africa. It reveals the extent of degraded areas and shows areas that can be restored as well as how. He said that such maps will be replicated for Latin America and Asia in 2020.Panelists and participants also pointed to:the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture approach, which helps farmers visualize the state of their farms through predictive modeling;a project in Belize that has permitted tracing fisheries resources from ocean to table, enabling decisions on fishing quotas;an online tool used in Brazil to identify areas for expansion of soy farming while minimizing environmental impacts;the need for food traceability along the whole supply chain, and transparency to both farmers and consumers;digitization to encourage youth involvement in smallholder farming, noting that greater investment in infrastructure can prevent rural-to-urban migration; andtraining local communities to promote ownership of both the challenges and solutions.The shared experiences from the event will feed into public policy briefings on facilitating the technological and digital revolution for sustainable and resilient agriculture. These will be disseminated to agriculture ministries at theFAO Regional Conferences in 2020. [IISD RS Coverage of the Side Event] [FAO Website]****IISD Reporting Services is providingcoverage of selected side eventsduring the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, which met through 13 December.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
"September 2019: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has launched a website for the second UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference, which will focus on the opportunities, challenges and solutions towards achieving sustainable transport objectives such as access for all while leaving no one behind, green mobility, efficiency and safety.The 2020 event will follow up on thefirstGlobal Sustainable Transport Conference, held in 2016 in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and is expected to pave the way forward for sustainable transport to help reach the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.According to the website, transport enables the mobility of people and goods, and enhances economic growth and livelihoods, while at the same time improving access to quality health, education and finance services. While transport strengthens connectivity “at all levels,” and helps integrate economies, improve social equity, enhance rural-urban linkages and build resilience, it also has negative environmental, social and health impacts. For example, the website notes, transport generates almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and emissions from transport are projected to rise substantially in the coming years, further contributing to climate change.Emissions from transport are projected to rise substantially in the coming years.The second Global Sustainable Transport Conference will draw on discussions and ongoing action on sustainable transport in various fora, including theUN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development(HLPF), the Group of 7 (G7)Leaders’ Summitand the UN Secretary-General’sClimate Action Summit. It will seek to contribute to a number of SDGs, some of which are directly connected to sustainable transport through targets and indicators, including SDG target 3.6 on addressing deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents and SDG target 11.2 on providing access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all and on expanding public transport.The conference will bring together key stakeholders from government, the UN system and other international organizations, the private sector and civil society to discuss the integrated and cross-cutting nature of sustainable transport and the multiple ways in which it supports the attainment of the 2030 Agenda. The event will address all modes of transport, including road, rail, aviation and waterborne, along with recent scientific and technological advances in the field.The event will give particular attention to the concerns of vulnerable groups such as women, the youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities and the poor, as well as those of developing countries, including least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS).The Conference will be held from 5-7 May 2020 in Beijing, China.

"24 September 2019: Twelve multilateral agencies have launched a ten-year global action plan detailing how they will jointly support countries to achieve health-related aspects of the SDGs. The plan is relevant not only to SDG 3 on health, but also to SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 10 on reducing inequalities.The World Health Organization (WHO), in its global monitoring report on UHC,predictsthat up to five billion of the world’s population will still not have access to essential health services by 2030.The plan titled, ‘Stronger Collaboration, Better Health: Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All,’ was launched during the UN High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which took place on 23 September 2019, in New York, US. Speakers at the launch event noted that UHC is key to achieving health targets throughout the 2030 Agenda.The 12 agencies will harmonize their systems to reduce the administrative burden on countries receiving support.The Plan outlines cooperation among several UN agencies: UNAIDS, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, the World Food Programme (WFP) and WHO. Others involved are: GAVI, the vaccine alliance; Unitaid, a global health initiative to prevent, diagnose and treat major diseases in low- and middle-income countries; the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF); the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the World Bank Group.The 12 agencies’ cooperation will focus on seven “accelerator themes” primary health care; sustainable health financing; community and civil society engagement; determinants of health; innovative programming in fragile and vulnerable settings and for disease outbreak responses; research and development, innovation and access; and data and digital health. They also agree to harmonize their systems to reduce the administrative burden on countries receiving support from them, and to review progress together.The plan, coordinated by WHO, was developed over an 18-month period. Germany, Ghana and Norway had called for improving coordination and efficiency among global health organizations. Together, the 12 agencies account for almost one-third of all development assistance for health.Among the heads of agencies welcoming the plan, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women,expressed confidencethat the Global Action Plan will serve as a roadmap for collective action, so that more women and girls will be able to exercise informed decision-making and control over their bodies, and live their lives free from violence by 2030.The plan was launched on the same day that the UN High-Level Meeting on UHCadopteda historic declaration on ensuring that everyone has access to essential health services without experiencing financial hardship.

"The ministers and senior officials representing Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Viet Nam issued a joint statement following the third meeting of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP) Commission.The third meeting of the CPTPP Commission convened virtually on 5 August 2020, and was hosted by Mexico.Thejoint statementrecognizes the “unprecedented challenges” posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the health and well-being of communities, social cohesion, livelihoods, and adherence to the principles of free and open trade. The statement highlights CPTPP members’ “commitment to rules-based trade by maintaining open supply chains, active communication, transparency, and prompt notification of trade measures.” It underscores the importance of countering protectionism and reinforcing “an open, effective, fair, inclusive and rules-based trading system to restore economic growth worldwide.”The CPTPP members express their resolve to continue work towards post-COVID-19 economic recovery by establishing and strengthening supply chains, and examining ways the CPTPP could be used to facilitate digital trade responses to COVID-19. The countries commit to avoid “unjustified trade restrictive measures” and to facilitate the flow of essential goods and services during the COVID-19 crisis, including medical supplies and equipment, medicines, and agriculture and food products “in a manner consistent with international trade rules.”The CPTPP members reaffirm their “strong commitment” to upholding and supporting the World Trade Organization (WTO), which “sits at the core of the rules-based Multilateral Trading System.” The countries indicate that they “will work to inject increased momentum into WTO reform, including of its dispute settlement system.”The CPTTP Agreement entered into force on 30 December 2018. The inaugural meeting of the CPTPP Commission took place on 19 January 2019 in Tokyo, Japan, where members discussed elements needed for effective implementation of the Agreement, and how it can be expanded in the future. The Commission adopted ajoint statementand four decisions on: anapproachto administering the Agreement;rules of proceduresfor dispute settlement panels; acode of conductfor investor-state dispute settlement; and aprocess for the accessionof new economies to the CPTPP.The Commission’s second meeting convened from 7-9 October 2019, in Auckland, New Zealand, to monitor and advance implementation of the CPTPP’s obligations. The Commission issued ajoint statement, and adopteddecisionson its rules of procedure and on the establishment of a roster of individuals who may be selected to serve as panel chairs to address state-to-state disputes.The role of trade deals has become the subject of heightened debate amid the economic effects of COVID-19, as governments consider how to support vulnerable sectors, ensure access to medicines and medical technologies for their populations, and address job losses. Prior to the pandemic, experts had begun questioning whether the CPTPP yielded the expected economic benefits for the seven ratifying countries.In addition, the agreement’s rules on intellectual property (IP) and digital trade, among other issues, play into debate within some CPTPP signatory countries on whether to proceed with ratification, and for other countries regarding whether to request accession.

"Representatives from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) that will present their Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) at the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) convened for a workshop for strengthening national capacities to address opportunities and challenges associated with the VNR process.The meeting was organized by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in Santiago, Chile, from 3-4 February 2020. The workshop aimed to go beyond VNR preparation, adopting a more strategic approach regarding “second-generation VNRs” and focusing on national-level appropriation and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The workshop addressed: identification of national and sub-national priorities and gaps; statistical and data capacity for measuring the SDGs aimed at evidence-based decision making; integration of the SDGs into planning and budgeting schemes; evaluation of the SDG financing architecture; and multi-actor participation and commitment.Government representatives from ten of the 11 countries that will present their VNRs in 2020 attended the meeting, namely Argentina, Barbados, Bolivia, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. In addition, government representatives that have presented VNRs in past year shared their experiences and lessons learned.Representatives from ECLAC, the private sector, and civil society also participated in sessions that addressed planning, financing for development, and data and statistics. UN Resident Coordinators from the region provided insight into their role and experience in supporting countries to deliver on the 2030 Agenda, examining: lessons learned and links between VNR processes; regional, national and sub-national strategies; and available policies, tools and opportunities, particularly UN contributions.The workshop identified recommendations to address sustainable development challenges for the beginning of the UN Decade of Action for the SDGs, which requires accelerating sustainable solutions to achieve the SDGs by 2030, and addressing such challenges as reducing poverty and inequality, achieving gender equality, fighting climate change, and closing financial gaps.The meeting, organized with support from the Government of Germany, was held in advance of the fourth meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, which will take place from 28-31 March 2020, in Havana, Cuba. [ECLAC Press Release]",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"17 October 2019: CGIAR announced a global initiative called Crops to End Hunger (CtEH), which will enhance its contributions to the SDGs through high-priority staple crops bred to meet the specific needs of targeted regions and their populations. The initiative is designed to accelerate and modernize how CGIAR and its partners develop, deliver and scale up the use of new crop varieties.CtEH was launched on 17 October 2019, at the World Food Prize’s Borlaug Dialogue in Des Moines, Iowa, US.In 2017 and 2018, a multi-funder group, including the US Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Department for International Development, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research partnered to launch a modernization program for public plant breeding in lower-income countries. The resulting CtEH initiative aims to invigorate breeding for the staple crops most important to smallholder farmers and poor consumers, while supporting CGIAR’s “central role and responsibility” for the conservation and characterization of the world’s crop biodiversity.Twenty CGIAR crops, including cereals, legumes and root crops, were chosen for the breeding initiative, which will develop new varieties to meet the food, nutrition and income needs of producers and consumers, respond to market demands, and provide resilience to pests, diseases and new environmental challenges arising from climate change. The initiative aims to address the “tightly interlinked” challenges of meeting the SDGs on hunger (SDG 2), extreme poverty (SDG 1), and climate change (SDG13).CGIAR notes that the modernization of its breeding programs will provide multiple benefits. For example, the CtEH is expected to increase the rates of “genetic gain” and the scale of impact through the adoption of farmer-preferred, market-demanded and climate-resilient varieties. The initiative will foster closer cooperation between national breeding programs, national research institutes and universities, and small and medium-sized enterprises in the private sector in low-income countries, as well as multilateral seed companies and advanced research institutes. The CtEH will also adopt standardized ways of reporting needs, opportunities and progress, which will provide funders with a transparent view of their return on investment.Ending hunger in our lifetimes is possible, even in the face of the climate emergency, but it requires an urgent transformation of our food system.Speaking on the initiative, Elwyn Grainger-Jones, CGIAR’s Executive Director said that ending hunger in our lifetimes is possible, even in the face of the climate emergency, but that it requires an urgent transformation of our food system, driven by more innovation and partnerships.

"The UN Global Compact launched a three-year strategy to increase businesses’ contributions to the SDGs. The plan calls for companies to demonstrate continuous improvement in advancing the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Ten Principles of the Global Compact.The strategic plan covers the years 2021-2023, and cites the need for “global collective action to change the way that businesses operate” including how they affect the environment.By the plan announced on 19 January 2021, the Global Compact will use specific, measurable targets to move participant companies faster and farther than those who are not part of the Compact, demonstrating more progress on corporate sustainability and tangible contributions to the SDGs. The plan also lays out efforts to empower the Global Compact’s local networks and launch new national and regional network with a focus on China, the US, and the global south. It will prioritize action and measurable impact on five SDGs: Goal 5 (gender equality); Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth); Goal 13 (climate action); Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (partnership for the Goals).Participants in the UN Global Compact include over 12,000 companies and 3,000 non-business signatories, making it “the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative.” Participants commit toTen Principlescovering human rights, labor, environmental protection, and anti-corruption.Sanda Ojiambo, UN Global Compact CEO & Executive Director, said the purpose of the 2021-2023 strategy is to lead participating companies towards continuous, demonstrated improvement in their impacts and “raise expectations of how businesses will embed all Ten Principles.” She said the Principles serve as businesses’ “enabler” for helping to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who serves as Chair of the Board of the Global Compact, added that the Ten Principles guide businesses in helping collective efforts to build back stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic.Participants in the Global Compact are required to report annually using a framework called the Communication on Progress (CoP). The CoP is currently undergoing a review to enable companies to better align their sustainability reporting with the global sustainable development agenda. According to an Information Note, the new CoP is expected to include more granular questions on the SDG and Ten Principles and strengthen criteria for third-party data verification and assurance. As a result, the revised framework would:Provide governments with tangible, credible data on the private sector’s contribution to the SDGs, to reflect in their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs);Help UN organizations identify partners in the business community; andEnable businesses to track their own progress over time, compare their performance with peers, and publicly showcase progress towards the Ten Principles and SDGs.According to the strategic plan, the refreshed CoP will help provide an aggregate view of companies’ impacts on sustainable development. The Global Compact plans to relaunch the CoP in 2021. [UN Global Compact press release] [Publication:UN Global Compact Strategy 2021-2023] [Information Note on CoP review process]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
"21 September 2019: The UNFCCC convened an event in New York, US, ahead of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, bringing together representatives from government, the UN and civil society to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the UNFCCC and discuss the way forward.The event was hosted by the UNFCCC Bureau, under the leadership of Michał Kurtyka, President of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC. It sought to identify ways for the UNFCCC to further: stimulate greater ambition of climate action and support governments and stakeholders in shaping their vision for a climate-resilient and emissions-neutral future; and support strong implementation at the national, regional and international levels.The Convention has delivered a well-designed framework for global climate action for all.Noting the UNFCCC’s near universal membership, Kurtyka stated that, over the years, it has created a “toolbox” to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, build resilience and provide the necessary technology, capacity building and finance to do so. “The Convention has delivered a well-designed framework for global climate action for all, respecting national sovereignty but able to gradually ramp up global ambition. The Paris Agreement and Katowice Rulebook are state-of-the-art mechanisms with so much potential. But we need the collective political willingness to now move forward,” he said.Acknowledging the UNFCCC’s successes, other Bureau members highlighted the need for greater ambition, enhanced implementation, and understanding of the science in order to take effective action.UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, described the last 25 years as a “time of challenges and opportunities, with disappointments matched by some incredible successes.” UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, highlighted greater collaboration among all actors on the SDGs and the climate change agenda as “a major bright spot.”Highlighting the importance of governments and non-state actors such as industries, cities and citizens working together, President Designate of COP 25, Chile’s Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, stated that the Santiago Climate Change Conference will build on the momentum of the UN Climate Action Summit.

"Canadians value water more than any other of our natural resources, including oil and gas. A January 2017 survey on attitudes about water by the Royal Bank, for example, found that 45% of respondents viewed fresh water as Canada’s most important resource. Only 25% of respondents rated petroleum as the most important resource.But you would never know this prioritization by our public policy priorities. While Canadians are consumed by debates about pipelines, Lake Winnipeg is dying, boil advisories continue to plague remote communities, and we have not even mapped our groundwater aquifers, all while we continue to allow companies like Nestle to withdraw vast amounts of fresh water for only a pittance. On sensible water policies and priorities, Canadians are sleepwalking into the 21st century.We are not alone in ignoring the centrality of water: four billion people, or 66% of the world’s population, lives without sufficient access to fresh water for at least one month each year, according to the journal ‘Science Advances.’ This situation arises because both India and China are suffering severe water shortages. For that reason, the World Economic Forum has placed water risk in the top three global problems, along with climate change and terrorism. But water rarely makes it onto the agenda of the G20, and leaders like Donald Trump are making their own water problems worse rather than helping the world to cope with growing crises.A global leadership vacuum on water exists, and Canada could and should fill it. Domestically, a Minister for Water should be appointed to the Cabinet to galvanize action, as Catherine McKenna has done on climate change. In international development policy, Canada should make water risk its central organizational focus, because water is critical to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as it is a connector between health, food and the environment.There is another international dimension to water that the world is starting to realize: in 2012 in Canada, the InterAction Council of former world leaders, led by Jean Chretien, declared that water scarcity was a threat to peace and recommended that the UN Security Council take up the issue. In November 2016, for the first time, the Security Council did indeed debate the topic of ‘Water, Peace and Security.’ If Canada hopes to win election to the Security Council, what better platform than leading the world to realize that water is connected to peace?Canada’s 150th anniversary is a time to celebrate the past, but more importantly, it is a time to look forward to new goals and priorities. Jahmai Moskotaywenene, an elementary student in St. Pius school in Thunder Bay, did this recently in a letter written to the prime minister: “Dear Mr. Trudeau, my class and I want to make Canada’s people equal. We also want to make everybody’s amount of water equal. Everybody should have the same amount of water to drink, bathe and wash their hands without getting rashes.” Amen to that for Canada and the world!This article originally appeared in Water Canada",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"4 October 2019: Discussions at a workshop titled, ‘Gaining consensus on spatial and temporal biodiversity metrics for informed decision-making’, contributed to a report summarizing key approaches for building the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The publication aims to identify some of the best available data, tools and platforms to support the framework’s design, as well as ways to monitor its implementation from 2020-2030.The workshop took place from 20-24 May 2019, at the University of Cambridge, UK. Luc Hoffmann Institute, the UN Environment Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), National Geographic Society, the NatureMap consortium, and the biodiversity hub of the Science-Based Targets Network organized the event.Participants in the workshop explored a range of frameworks and approaches to monitoring biodiversity and measuring progress towards policy targets. The meeting also raised issues related to knowledge gaps, the need to capture the multiple dimensions of biodiversity, and what it means to live in harmony with nature.The event’s outcome report titled, ‘ A synthesis of available scientific input to inform the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework,’ was developed to support government negotiators, national focal points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and observer organizations in the development and subsequent implementation of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.The publication provides linked worksheets on available spatial data on biodiversity, benefits to people, and threats to nature, available indicators to measure progress towards targets, and proposed new targets published in scientific literature. It also identifies existing data platforms to support implementation.The report summarizes the workshop’s discussions under the following categories:Outlining options for operationalizing the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity;Outlining proposed approaches for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework;Outlining scientific proposals for an overall biodiversity state index (including biodiversity benefits to people), or set of indicators that could be useful to measure progress to 2030;Exploring approaches to better connect biodiversity with climate change and land degradation agendas;Progress towards the development of action-oriented targets;Summarizing the scientific status of potential indicators to measure progress towards 2030;Summarizing the scientific status of spatial data that can assist countries and other stakeholders to plan ways to implement the post-2020 global biodiversity framework; andSummarizing the scientific status of web-based platforms that can support countries and other stakeholders who will implement the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.Governments are to adopt the post-2020 global biodiversity framework at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD, which is expected to take place in Kunming, China, in October 2020.

As part of this, he said he willconvene an annual platform to drive the decade of action.An “annual temperature check” on SDG progress will take place each September in the context of the UNGA debate.The call for a decade of action stems from a request made to the Secretary-General in thepolitical declarationof the SDG Summit, which was adopted on 24 September 2019 by the heads of state and government in attendance. The text asks the Secretary-General to “engage Governments, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders in generating solutions and accelerating action to address systemic gaps in implementation, as we embark on a decisive decade for the 2030 Agenda. We also call upon the Secretary-General to organize an annual moment to highlight inspiring action on the Goals, in the context of the general debate of the General Assembly” (paragraph 26).UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed elaborated on these plans in remarks to a civil society event on 25 September. She said the UN will provide space each September within the UN General Assembly for “an annual temperature check” on SDG progress. This will provide “a snapshot of what’s working and what’s not, of where we need more action and who we need more action from.”During theintergovernmental consultationson the political declaration in June 2019, Norway proposed including a call to convene an annual “SDG Moment” during the opening of each UNGA session until 2030, except in those years when the HLPF is meeting under the UNGA’s auspices in September.

"12 June 2019: The European Court of Auditors issued a review of the EU’s reporting on SDG achievement and sustainable development, both at the EU level and reporting by individual EU agencies and institutions. The auditors conclude that the EU has not yet created the building blocks for meaningful reporting on sustainability.Eurostat reports on indicators and SDG progress, but does not measure the EU’s contribution to achieving the SDGs.The European Court of Auditors’ report titled, ‘Reporting on Sustainability: A Stocktake of EU Institutions and Agencies,’ observes the EU’s stated commitment to implementing the SDGs, and notes that many EU laws require large companies to report on sustainability. However, the auditors find that the European Commission (EC) is not leading by example on sustainability reporting. Moreover, they observe that the EU lacks a strategy on sustainable development through 2030 that identifies the SDGs relevant for the EU and relevant objectives and targets.The report notes that the Commission’s statistical body, Eurostat, publishes annual reports on indicators and progress related to the SDGs, using statistical information collected by EU member States. It does not, however, measure the contribution of EU budget and policies to sustainable development and achieving the SDGs.The auditors identify two EU institutions and agencies that publish sustainability reports: the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the EU Intellectual Property Office. Reporting by others is “often piecemeal and incomplete and does not cover all aspects of sustainability,” they write. In general, EU institutions and agencies provide information on “how the running of their organization affects sustainability, such as their use of paper or water,” rather than how they consider sustainability in overall operations and strategy. The authors note that the EC has begun to adapt its performance reporting system in the area of external action to the SDGs and sustainability.The auditors further identify challenges related to increasing credibility through audit, noting that sustainability risks can often become financial risks. They argue that external assurance of sustainability reports “can increase credibility and stakeholders’ trust” in information provided and reduce the risk of “greenwashing.” The report highlights some key results of supreme audit institutions (SAI) audits on the SDGs. In Austria, for example, the government adopted a mainstreaming approach to the SDGs, but the Austrian SAI found that the country did not adequately define overall responsibility, resulting in a fragmented implementation process and a lack of coordination in evaluation and reporting.Eva Lindström, European Court of Auditors, said that in light of the EU’s commitment to achieving the SDGs, “we would expect the Commission to be able to report on the results achieved.” Lindström underscored the importance of “reliable information on how the EU contributes” to sustainable development and climate change.

"8 July 2019: The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) has published two policy briefs on water resource management ahead of the 2019 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The briefs highlight the role of water diplomacy in resolving conflict and promoting joint management of shared freshwater resources, and the role of water management in achieving the SDGs. SIWI underscores the need for trust building and better cooperation among water actors, and for linking available technical knowledge with political discussions and decision making.A policy brief titled, ‘Water Diplomacy: Facilitating Dialogues,’ notes that more than 50% of the world’s population relies on freshwater from transboundary basins, yet 60% of international river basins are not covered by any kind of cooperative management framework. The authors draw attention to the promise of multi-track water diplomacy processes, noting that many water diplomacy processes take place in an informal context or through non-state actors. They suggest that, to be effective, water diplomacy processes need to be flexible enough to respond to changing political landscapes and the impacts of climate change, and must take account of available technical knowledge. [Publication:Water Diplomacy: Facilitating Dialogues] [Publication Landing Page]A policy brief on ‘Connecting the SDGs Through Resilient Water Management’ highlights the value of action on water in reducing poverty (SDG 1), promoting food security (SDG 2), ending inequality (SDG 10), taking climate action (SDG 13), stemming environmental degradation (SDGs 14 and 15), and promoting peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16). The authors call for: improving the effectiveness, fairness and transparency of water governance from the local to transboundary levels; “climate-proofing” water management tools and approaches; recognizing the value of water for social, environmental and economic prosperity; and taking a human rights approach to water that empowers women, youth, indigenous populations, and vulnerable groups.

"The UN Secretary-General has issued a roadmap to “connect, respect, and protect” everyone in the context of artificial intelligence and other technological developments.Published as a report of the Secretary-General on 11 June 2020, the ‘Roadmap for Digital Cooperation’ discusses a set of recommendations developed by a high-level panel in 2019, and provides action points for the way forward.In July 2018, the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation was established by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to strengthen international and multi-stakeholder cooperation and contribute to the public debate on a safe and inclusive digital future for all. It was chaired by philanthropist Melinda Gates and e-business leader Jack Ma. In June 2019, after a series of in-person meetings of the members and regional consultations, the Panel issued areporttitled, ‘The Age of Digital Interdependence.’ A follow-up process to the report engaging UN Member States and over 300 other entities (listed in an annex to the Secretary-General’s report) was coordinated by the Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th Anniversary.In the roadmap publication, Guterres notes that effective digital cooperation “is instrumental in achieving the ‘future we want’ and the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is not something that any country, company or institution can achieve alone.”The report makes recommendations for action by various stakeholders, in order to “accelerate global digital cooperation, seizing on the opportunities that are presented by technology – while mitigating the risks – so that progress towards achieving the Goals by 2030 can be made collectively.”Among the action points for the way forward:On the UN as a convener, in 2021 the Secretary-General will appoint an Envoy on Technology to help facilitate a multi-stakeholder policy dialogue on emerging technologies and guide the UN’s strategy on technology trends, which is currently being updated. The report notes that a forthcoming report of the Task Force on the Digital Financing of the SDGs also will contribute to this discussion.On human rights, dignity, and agency in a “digitally interdependent age,” the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will develop system-wide guidance on human rights due diligence and impact assessments in the use of new technologies.On Artificial Intelligence (AI), the UN Secretary-General plans to establish a multi-stakeholder advisory body to address inclusion, coordination, and capacity-building for Member States.[Publication:Report of the Secretary-General: Roadmap for Digital Cooperation] [Press release from Panel secretariat] [UN Digital Cooperation Website]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"16 September 2019: The Bern Network on Financing Data for Development has released a paper and one-page summary outlining a proposed facility for financing data and statistics. The multi-donor Data Financing Facility would build on existing mechanisms and take lessons learned from other global funds.The Bern Network on Financing Data for Development is an open, multi-stakeholder collaboration to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by promoting more and better financing for data. It aims to advance implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data, and is working toward a robust funding framework to be presented at the UN World Data Forum on Sustainable Development Data 2020 in Bern, Switzerland.Launched at the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), the documents highlight that data to understand the scope of low- and middle-income countries’ challenges are still lacking (let alone data on solutions and progress towards the SDGs). The Network calls for a doubling of financial support to statistics, from current levels of about 0.33% official development assistance (ODA) to 0.7%, which the documents note “could achieve significant progress” on the aim of leaving no one behind.The envisioned Facility’s primary aims are: encouraging partner country awareness of and commitment to development data; incentivizing improved in-country investment; and supporting and/or convening research and development initiatives. The one-page summary notes that the Facility could: provide incentives for coordination and alignment with national strategies, which would be an improvement on existing schemes; raise additional domestic and international funds for national statistical authorities; and drive progress towards widely agreed metrics.The Facility would feature two thematic funding windows. The first would provide national statistics offices (NSOs) with a match funding response for critical data capacity gaps. The second would offer seeding, and blend financing for data architecture and service delivery applications.The documents also outline critical actions to strengthen donor coordination on statistics, including:Boosting statistical capacity;Promoting international engagement and standard-setting;Improving coordination for knowledge sharing;Creating pooling arrangements for improved support to development data; andImproving monitoring of investments in data.The release of the paper marks the end of the Bern Network’s technical work, and a shift towards socializing the analysis at key milestones to catalyze change. These milestones include the “Senior HLPF” and SDG Summit in September 2019, the World Bank meetings in October 2019, and the UN’s annual Financing for Development (FFD) Forum in 2020.In September 2019, three experts – Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, UN High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS); El Iza Mohamedou, PARIS21; and Koffi Zougbede, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – welcomed the Bern Network’s initiative, calling on recipient countries, donors and development agencies to align around investment in data. Their op-ed at IPS News adds further context to the challenge of data collection, noting that no least developed country (LDC) has a complete set of national statistics.

"25 June 2019: The SDG Lab, a multi-stakeholder initiative to support SDG actors based in Geneva, Switzerland, launched a toolkit that provides insight into the methods, tools and techniques that can help deliver on the 2030 Agenda. The toolkit is intended to support users in localizing the SDGs, testing new tools, connecting with new stakeholders, incubating partnerships, co-creating solutions, and learning from other implementation successes and challenges.The SDG Labtoolkittitled, ‘Activating the 2030 Agenda,’ was launched on 25 June 2019. It consolidates 11 tools that have been tested since the Lab’s founding, which are grouped according to the Lab’s four areas of work. Those areas are: Connect, Amplify, Ask Questions and Innovate.The tools outlined under ‘Connect’ seek to help create new opportunities for actors to co-create solutions and exchange information, experiences, and ideas for collaboration. The ‘Amplify’ section of the toolkit outlines ways to learn from and build on each other’s practice, and the ‘Ask Questions’ seeks to support users in asking key questions that uncover new ways of thinking and new paths to action. The ‘Innovate’ section of the toolkit encourages experimentation with new approaches, formats and processes, as well as risk-taking and learning from failure.The toolkit provides an overview of what each tool aims to achieve, why it should be considered, how to implement it, a list of practical suggestions, and templates. It also contains a list of additional resources developed by organizations within the Geneva 2030Ecosystem– a multi-stakeholder initiative that mobilizes Geneva’s capacity, skills, experience and ideas to implement the SDGs. These additional resources are categorized as whether they relate to process, assessment, technology, human rights, and SDGs in general.TheSDG Labis led by the UN Office at Geneva (UNOG).

"Following consultations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that five out of eight candidates for the post of WTO Director-General will advance to the next stage of the selection process. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (Nigeria), Yoo Myung-hee (Republic of Korea), Amina C. Mohamed (Kenya), Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri (Saudi Arabia), and Liam Fox (UK) received “the broadest and deepest support from the WTO membership.”Jesús Seade Kuri (Mexico), Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh (Egypt), and Tudor Ulianovschi (Moldova) will not advance to the next phase.According to theguidelinesfor the third and final stage of the selection process agreed by the General Council on 31 July, WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand), with Chair of the Dispute Settlement Body Dacio Castillo (Honduras) and Chair of the Trade Policy Review Body Harald Aspelund (Iceland), conducted confidential consultations with WTO members from 7-16 September 2020 to identify their preferences. On 16 September, the pool of candidates was reduced from eight to five. The results and the next steps in the selection process were announced at a Heads of Delegation meeting on 18 September.The second phase of confidential consultations will take place from 24 September to 6 October. WTO members will be requested to submit their preferences to “the troika” (Walker, Castillo, and Aspelund), following which the field of candidates will be reduced from five to two. At that time, the timetable for the third and final round of consultations will be announced.According to the WTO, the “ultimate objective of this measured and clearly defined process is to secure a consensus decision by members on the next Director-General.”The selection process for the new Director-General started on 14 May when former WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he would step down from his post on 31 August, cutting his term short by one year. General Council Chair Walker immediatelyinitiatedthe process by engaging with WTO members in accordance with the 2002procedures for the Director-General selection process.Eight WTO membersput forward candidatesfor the post during the nomination period, which ended on 8 July.

"The UNFCCC has announced the launch of a platform for theSantiago Networkthat will assist countries and organizations to identify opportunities to mobilize technical assistance and generate initiatives to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage resulting from climate change.TheWarsaw International Mechanismfor Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts was established at the 19th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 19) in 2013. It was mandated to enhance knowledge, strengthen dialogue and coordination, and enhance action to address loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change in vulnerable developing countries.In 2019, the Santiago Network was created atCOP25 in Madridto further the work of the loss and damage mechanism by catalyzing access to, and organizing the availability of, technical assistance to developing countries vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. The Network is designed to enable quick access to planning tools and solutions, organize the exchange of knowledge between organizations, facilitate new partnership arrangements, and convene organizations and experts to leverage additional resources and reduce the duplication of efforts.The establishment of the Santiago Network is still in early stages, with plans to develop the functions and website over time to better align with countries’ needs for technical assistance. The initial platform will provide a space to quickly channel assistance into operations, mid- to long-term investments, humanitarian services, and immediate technical needs.Carolina Schmidt, Chile’s Minister of Environment and COP 25 President, said, “It is my personal hope that the Santiago Network will spark new partnerships, joint ventures, consortiums and technical corporations, and we have requested the secretariat to proceed along these principles.” [UNFCCC News Release]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
"9 October 2019: Cities must employ “transformative” climate change adaptation solutions in transitioning to more equitable and sustainable growth, according to a paper published by the World Resources Institute (WRI).The paper titled, ‘Unlocking the Potential for Transformative Climate Adaptation in Cities,’ explains that while cities are increasingly integrating climate adaptation priorities into development policies and plans, a gap remains in understanding the ways in which incremental urban adaptation solutions can lead to more transformative change over the long term. Such change, the paper argues, can improve lives, enhance urban vibrancy, and ensure resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities.The paper explains that transformative adaptation enables cities to achieve synergies across multiple goals, including provision of services and infrastructure, climate change mitigation, ecosystem protection, economic growth and sustainable development objectives at the local level.The paper highlights three action areas to help advance transformative urban adaptation, and their direct and indirect links to each of the SDGs. The action areas are:mainstreaming information on climate risks into planning and delivery of urban infrastructure and services, while strengthening local capacity to act on that information;building climate resilience by upgrading living conditions in vulnerable communities and informal settlements, drawing on local experience and community knowledge; andprioritizing nature-based solutions to holistically manage water and heat risks.To help cities prioritize climate adaptation solutions, according to the paper, the strategies must be integrated with each other, and require common enabling conditions for transformative adaptation in cities, including: strong leadership; inclusion and equity; finance and local capacity; synergies across national, regional and global scales; knowledge, data and partnerships; evaluation and learning; and accountable institutions and governance. The paper also provides detailed recommendations to ensure progress and timescales for each recommendation.The publication was launched at the C40 World Mayors Summit, which convened from 9-12 October in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is part of a series of background papers commissioned by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) to inform its 2019 flagship report, ‘Adapt Now: A Global Call for Leadership on Climate Resilience.’ [Publication:Unlocking the Potential for Transformative Climate Adaptation in Cities] [WRI Paper Landing Page] [WRI News Story]",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"10 October 2019: The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators is considering 53 suggested changes to the SDG indicator framework based on input gathered through an open consultation. The IAEG-SDGs is expected to agree on a final set of proposals during its upcoming tenth meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.As part of the 2020 Comprehensive Review of the indicator framework called for in a2017 UN General Assembly resolution, the IAEG held an “open call” in late May and June 2019 for proposed changes to the SDG indicators. It received approximately200 proposalsfor additions, deletions, replacements and revisions to the indicators, including 25 suggestions of additional indicators. IAEG members then reduced this input to53 proposalsfor a consultation held in August and early September 2019.Among those currently proposed for addition are indicators on:SDG 2: anemia, low birthweight and breastfeeding;SDG 3: mental disorders, public spending on primary health care, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR);SDG 4: tertiary education enrollment ratio by sex;SDG 8: energy use by tourism industries;SDG 10: Palma ratio, Gini coefficient and migrant deaths at borders;SDG 13: GHG emissions, GHG concentrations, number of NAPs, and pledges to the Green Climate Fund (GCF);SDG 15: Living Planet Index;SDG 16: refugees as a proportion of origin country’s population; andSDG 17: TOSSD – Total Official Support for Sustainable Development.The comments received on these and other proposals can be seen in the Excel file titled, ‘Compilations of inputs received during the Open Consultation,’ atthis page.IAEG members are reviewing the most recent input and in some cases requesting further information. The Group aims to finalize a revised set of proposals on 21 October 2019 during a one-day meeting open only to IAEG members. Other countries and stakeholders can discuss the resulting proposals during the plenary segment of the meeting taking place from 22-24 October.Following IAEG-SDG 10, the Group will make any needed refinements before submitting its proposal to the UN Statistical Commission ahead of its 51st session in March 2020.The IAEG has set out guiding principles for the 2020 Comprehensive Review process. These include not imposing significant additional burdens on national statistical work, and limiting the scope of changes to keep the overall size of theindicator frameworkapproximately the same. Therefore, it is expected that replacement indicators are more likely to be agreed upon than additional indicators.The tenth IAEG-SDGs meeting (agenda here) also will: consider seven tier reclassification requests based on data availability; discuss work plans for the Tier III indicators not proposed for reclassification nor included in the 2020 review; and discuss data disaggregation, indicators and targets with a 2020 deadline, and “other SDG data initiatives” for monitoring the Goals.The most recent reclassification of an indicator was to SDG indicator 12.6.1 on the number of companies publishing sustainability reports, which was moved from Tier III to Tier II in September 2019. More information on the tier classification of the indicators is availablehere.

"A report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) investigates the links between gender-based violence (GBV) and environment. The publication lays bare how the struggle for the control of natural resources and environmental pressure and threats exacerbates violence against women and girls.Titled ‘Gender-based Violence and Environment Linkages; The violence of inequality,’ the publication draws from over 1,000 information sources and stakeholder interventions as well as informant interviews and a validation workshop. It also derives from 300 responses to a GBV-Environment survey and a call for case studies that led to 80 submissions addressing both challenges and solutions to the issues.The publication contains three main sections that address the relationship of GBV to: access and control of natural resources; environmental pressures and threats; and environmental action. The first section on access to natural resources discusses land, forests, agriculture and fisheries. It notes that GBV is often employed as a way to maintain power imbalances, violently reinforcing socio-cultural expectations and norms and exacerbating gender inequality.The next section investigates the connections of violence against women and girls to illegal logging, wildlife trade, fishing, and mining, as well as large scale extractive industries, and climate and weather-based disasters. The publication highlights that “competition over scarce resources in and between communities, households and industries amplifies normative, discriminatory and exploitative gender inequalities, giving way to a rise in GBV.” A subsequent discussion of the situation of women environmental rights defenders concludes that “GBV is used to assert power imbalances and, at times, violently discourage or stop women from speaking out for their rights, working toward or benefiting from a safe and healthy environment.”Gender-based abuse across environmental contexts affects the security of nations, communities and individuals, and jeopardizes meeting the SDGs.Overall, the publication concludes that “patterns of gender-based abuse are observed across environmental contexts, affecting the security and well-being of nations, communities and individuals, and jeopardizing meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” The Executive Summary points out, however, that “while linkages between GBV and environmental issues are complex and multi-layered, these threats to human rights and healthy ecosystems are not insurmountable.”The IUCN developed the report in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of the Advancing Gender in the Environment (AGENT) partnership.

"The first UN Biodiversity Summit highlighted the urgency of action at the highest levels in support of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework that contributes to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and places the global community on a path towards “living in harmony with nature” – the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity.The high-level event convened in the margins of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 30 September, in a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government and ministers joining virtually. The Summit focused on the theme, ‘Urgent Action on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development.’The opening segment included a “fireside chat” between the heads of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). They described biodiversity as a “shock absorber,” and said the time to “pollute our way to wealth” has passed.Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change.UN Secretary-General António Guterres said degradation of nature spans economics, social justice, and human rights, and can result in geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Many expressed concern that none of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be met. Speakers warned that biodiversity loss threatens food security, water supplies, and livelihoods, as well as our ability to fight diseases and face extreme events.Munir Akram, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), said political will, not finance, is key to contain “economic greed” and “policy negligence.” UNGA President Volkan Bozkir called on Member States to use the Summit to build political momentum towards a post‑2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Kunming, China in 2021. “Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change,” said Bozkir, by placing the biodiversity discourse firmly on the political agenda.A plenary session followed, during which participants highlighted the connections between biodiversity, societies, and economies.Two Leaders’ Dialogues focused on addressing biodiversity loss and mainstreaming biodiversity for sustainable development, and on harnessing science, technology and innovation, capacity building, access and benefit-sharing (ABS), financing, and partnerships for biodiversity.

"The latest policy brief in IISD’s ‘Still Only One Earth’ series observes that “no single organization owns the global sustainable energy transition,” and this is a source of strength. Its polycentric, non-hierarchical governance features could be used as a model for other environmental crises.The brief, authored by Mari Luomi, highlights that multilateral governance of energy remains scarce and fragmented, as does governance of sustainable energy. However, Luomi notes that “there have been some breakthroughs, including the establishment of the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative, the SDGs, and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).”Luomi argues that two major energy challenges must be overcome to achieve sustainable development: energy poverty and climate change. Five decades after theStockholm Conference on the Human Environmentrecognized the harmful environmental effects of energy production and use, scientists have determined that limiting global warming to safe levels requires leaving at least two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves unburned.The author recalls that the MDGs did not include an energy- specific goal, possibly because of a “long-standing disagreement between the Global South and North on whether energy was primarily a ‘social and economic good’ or an ‘environmental bad.'” She reports that the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative aimed to refocus the debate by emphasizing both the role of energy in sustainable development and the importance of protecting the environment (McDade, 2013), and its three targets adopted in 2011 influenced the negotiations on SDG 7, amounting to a “rather successful attempt to merge the access and transition agendas into one.”To achieve SDG 7, the brief says that governments and other stakeholders must form partnerships and coordinate significant transfers of technology and financing, especially to support the most vulnerable. As an early adopter of multi-stakeholder approaches, Luomi concludes, the sustainable energy sector provides positive examples and lessons for other areas of global governance. [Publication:The Global Governance of Sustainable Energy: Access and Sustainable Transitions]",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), GSMA, and the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) have issued a joint report to help companies in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry set targets in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The report titled, ‘Guidance for ICT Companies Setting Science Based Targets,’ aims to reach companies operating mobile networks, fixed networks and/or data centers. Current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trajectories for the ICT sector have been developed by GeSI, GSMA, ITU, and SBTi with support from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Sub-sector trajectories to 2030 have been developed for mobile network operators, fixed network operators, data center operators, user devices and manufacturers of ICT equipment. Each of these is consistent with a climate scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The ICT Sector trajectory calls for a 45% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030.Prompting readers on how to calculate ICT sub-sector targets, the report distinguishes between targets on direct emissions and emissions associated with use of electricity to run operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions respectively), from those covering emissions for a company’s broader value chain (Scope 3).In total, the ICT Sector trajectory calls for a 45% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. While the sector has historically been able to meet capacity and transmission demands, and simultaneously achieve targets through the purchase of renewable energy, the authors note that increasing size and complexity will require greater efforts. The report highlights actions on energy efficiency and encouraging behavior change among end users, in addition to further switching to renewable or low-carbon electricity sources.Additional details on the report’s methodology, as well as emission reduction factors and Scope 3 emissions categories, are available in the report’s annexes.Guidance for further ICT sub-sectors will be covered in a future release.

"In advance of the Madrid Climate Change Conference, the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action released a publication that calls on all actors to step up their climate action, unite behind science and collaborate in inclusive ways to support ‘Climate Action Pathways’ to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Yearbook concludes that progress can be accelerated with “leadership, clarity and ambition from national governments.”The ‘Yearbook of Global Climate Action 2019’ provides an assessment of actions by non-Party stakeholders, defined as regions and cities, businesses and civil society. The report shares examples of regional engagement in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and Asia-Pacific that galvanized support for theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, and summarizes subsequent Summit outcomes. The report also showcases examples of practical climate action and lessons learned for local governments, the private sector and other stakeholders, including to help policymakers identify opportunities for incentivizing climate-friendly action.Individual climate-thoughtful choices by everyone can add up to world-saving trends towards climate neutrality.The Yearbook finds that “many areas across all sectors” where “non-Party actors,” often in cooperation with each other and countries, are delivering actions and solutions to increase ambition. If current international cooperative initiative deliver on their goals, they “could close the global gap to the emission trajectory for 2 degrees Celsius of warming in 2030,” although a significant gap would still remain to achieve the 1.5°C goal. The Yearbook highlights the launch of theClimate Ambition Allianceto increase ambition by 2020 and provide leadership on the net-zero emissions by 2050 goal.The Yearbook further highlights the importance of individual behavior in moving towards climate neutrality. It states that “individual climate-thoughtful choices” by everyone can add up to “world-saving trends towards climate neutrality.” Consumer choices on modes of transport, the products they buy and the foods they eat can have a “significant impact” on deforestation, land use, transport emissions, industry transition and capital reallocation.To sufficiently raise climate ambition, the report recommends addressing five challenges. First, the report recommends viewing climate action holistically to realize increased cooperation across sectors and between actors. Second, the report calls for governments to remove barriers to implementation and move away from subsidies and incentives for fossil fuel-related areas and towards incentives for renewable and sustainable solutions to create the conditions needed for non-Party action. Third, the Yearbook highlights the importance of continuing and strengthening the Global Climate Action agenda within the post-2020 UNFCCC process. Fourth, the report recommends aligning finance flows with finance needs. Finally, the Yearbook calls for strengthening the reporting of results from climate action to inspire others to act.The 2019 Yearbook is the third edition of the Global Climate Action Yearbook.

"24 September 2019: Citing the World Atlas on Desertification, the European Union highlights that desertification affects 8% of its territory. To address this challenge, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has partnered with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Bank to restore 30 million hectares of land in Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, by 2030.Called ‘ECCA30,’ the initiative aims to hasten implementation of the Bonn Challenge, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially SDG target 15.3, which calls on countries to achieve a land degradation neutral (LDN) world by 2030. The Bonn Challenge calls for the restoration of 150 million hectares of the world’s deforested and degraded land by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030.Per the UNECE, the initiative will “build on growing political momentum in the region for land restoration as enshrined in theAstana Resolution.” Under this resolution and towards the Bonn Challenge, the UNECE has supported Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to restore approximately3 million hectaresof degraded lands.In addition to the above agreed goals and targets, the ECCA30 will enable nature-based solutions and forest landscape restoration (FLR) towards the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the LDN goal under UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Strategic Plan for Forests for 2017-2030 (UNSPF); and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).Launching the ECCA30 alongside theUN Climate Action Summit, UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova highlighted the importance of regional action to forest landscape restoration.

"An Asia-Pacific regional conference discussed how public and private financing for sustainable development can be raised through tax systems, capital markets, climate finance and development aid. The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has highlighted the need for an additional USD1.5 trillion a year or 5% of regional GDP to fully achieve the SDGs by 2030.The Asia-Pacific Conference on Financing for Inclusive and Sustainable Development took place from 10-12 December 2019, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The conference was organized by ESCAP and the Government of Bangladesh, with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) – Bangladesh and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), to discuss how investment and international development cooperation may be scaled up, and how countries may diversify both private and public financial flows.In avideo message, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for scaling up climate finance, investing in building resilience to climate change, and harnessing financial technology (fintech) to provide equitable financial access to all.In herkeynote address, Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, ESCAP Executive Secretary, emphasized to conference delegates that “ambition is our only option.” Alisjahbana noted some positive trends, namely improvements by countries in mobilizing tax revenue through modern and efficient systems, development of a pipeline of bankable projects for infrastructure financing, and the increasing role being played by capital markets in closing financing gaps. She also highlighted the role of digital technologies in improving access to financing for micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the potential for profit in the digital economy. She also cited negative trends such as the rise in trade protectionist measures, greater social inequality, and a higher incidence of climate change-related natural disasters.Alisjahbana highlighted three priority areas for action:Strengthening regional dialogues and cooperation on tax matters to address excessive tax competition across countries and tax evasion by multilateral corporations, both of which deprive developing countries of tax revenue;Improving planning, implementation and financing of national and cross-border infrastructure projects through regional cooperation, including participation in the Infrastructure Financing and Public-Private Partnership Network of Asia and the Pacific; andEnhancing fintech solutions to extend financing opportunities to micro-enterprises and SMEs, with a focus on women entrepreneurs.Several ministers from Asia and Europe attended the conference, along with more than 800 government officials, businesspeople, and representatives of international organizations and civil society. The conferencemarkedboth the 100th anniversary of the ICC and its 25th anniversary in Bangladesh.ESCAPestimatesthat, while 5% of regional GDP will be needed in additional investments to achieve the 2030 Agenda, countries in South Asia, where development needs are greater, will need 10% of regional GDP.

"The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), both of the CGIAR Consortium, merged at the beginning of 2019. In September 2019, they announced the creation of a new organization “born from the merger”: Resilient Landscapes. The organization will promote sustainable, innovative solutions to ensure integrated, multi-functional landscapes that are performing, productive and resilient and will help countries, communities and companies improve land management and livelihoods in sustainable and resilient ways.CIFOR and ICRAF merged in recognition that the complex environmental and social challenges arising from climate change, land degradation, food security and demographic changes demand inclusive, science-based solutions. They write that the “time for fragmented approaches has passed” and emphasize a need for viewing terrestrial landscapes “as integrated wholes from forests through farmlands to the edge of grasslands.” CIFOR and ICRAF state that working as one organization will allow them to leverage their legacy investment in research, policy and development to capitalize on emerging opportunities with greater agility and will drive efficiencies and greater value for money.Working as one organization will allow CIFOR and ICRAF to leverage their legacy investment in research, policy and development to capitalize on emerging opportunities with greater agility.The newly created Resilient Landscapes organization will focus on providing the evidence and innovative solutions to address global challenges and scale up investments in sustainable development. It will target science in development in two ways. First, Resilient Landscapes will address green-growth planning and deployment, with a focus on tree-based value chains. Second, the organization will promote nature-based solutions, including regenerative technologies, as economic enterprises.Resilient Landscapes will bring together scientists, development specialists, business and finance partners to implement large-scale landscape programs to protect, expand and value forests; rejuvenate the functions of degraded ecosystems; transform agriculture into sustainable systems; and mainstream biodiversity into national planning. The organization will also work to diversify and optimize agricultural and forestry value chains and support governments and the private sector in transitioning to sustainable economies.CIFOR and ICRAF merged in January 2019, with a common Board, and a commitment to work towards a single leadership team and unified policies, processes and systems. The Common Board of Trustees provides governance oversight while the day-to-day management of the Centres is delegated to the Directors General.

"3 October 2019: In its report ‘Water Under Fire,’ the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) calls for the provision of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in fragile and conflict-affected areas. The report highlights that civilian deaths in armed conflicts doubled between 2010 and 2016, and that many of these deaths occurred as a result of unmet needs, including access to safe drinking water.The report links WASH in the 2030 Agenda, especially SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, with other UN policy frameworks, namely, the UN ‘Sustaining Peace Agenda’ and the ‘Agenda for Humanity’ that was adopted at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.The report titled,Water Under Fire: Emergencies, development and peace in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, highlights the needs of 420 million children who lack access to basic sanitation, and 210 million who lack access to safe drinking water. The report presents a framework for WASH sector resilience that proposes actions plotted along a conflict continuum, from latent to acute and protracted conflict, through to post-conflict and recovery stages. The WASH agenda, in such contexts, includes early investment to prevent the decline and collapse of the WASH sector, actions to protect long-term water security, and adoption of renewable energy solutions that can continue to power water and sanitation systems during conflict.420 million children lack access to basic sanitation, and 210 million lack access to safe drinking water.Several case studies are presented, including actions to: prevent the spread of cholera in Haiti through agency coordination and focused WASH interventions in cholera hotspots; raising of blended finance from public and private lenders to upgrade water supply systems in Somaliland; and the use of renewable energy to power wastewater treatment in Jordan. The case studies do not provide an unbroken record of success, however, describing barriers and unforeseen circumstances that hampered implementation at different stages.The authors draw attention to the huge amount of capital investment that would be needed to achieve SDG 6 – US$114 billion a year – of which US$60 billion is needed for fragile contexts, and for which insufficient public funds have been raised. They conclude that innovative financing mechanisms and creative partnerships will be needed to attract the necessary funding and financing, and that WASH services themselves could serve as a platform for addressing fragility and conflict.

"Trucost, part of S&P Global, released an assessment of 500 large US companies’ impact on SDG achievement. The report describes growing investor appetite to benchmark companies against each other in terms of their SDG performance.The report titled, ‘Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Emerging Trends and Analysis of the SDG Impact of Companies in the S&P 500,’ underscores that the SDGs have become a popular means of communicating a company’s sustainability efforts, and that SDG-aligned language in reporting can attract capital. The S&P 500 is an index measuring the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US.Trucost maps four recent surveys of corporate SDG reporting, conducted by: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) & DNV GL; GlobeScan – SustainAbility; Oxfam; and KPMG. These studies find that many companies report on SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (climate action).However, these Goals do not completely align with companies’ “SDG risk.” The Trucost authors define “SDG risk” as the risk that a company may be directly or indirectly causing a negative impact on the Goal in question, or the risk that a company is dependent on a practice or activity that is in conflict with that Goal. The evaluation of companies’ SDG exposure captures a baseline level of risk related to private sector activities in particular industries and countries.Trucost modelled the risk exposure of companies listed in the S&P 500 using 45 metrics based on the SDGs’ 169 targets. The resulting analysis shows that key risks for these companies lie in issues relating to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). Three of the four surveys find that SDG 15 is one of the least prioritized by businesses. The only area of alignment between reporting and risk is in SDG 13, as companies are increasingly disclosing data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as their climate change risks and strategies.In mapping SDG risk for the metals and mining, technology and media, and real estate sectors, as well as the S&P 500 as a whole, the report delineates within each of these sectors the SDG exposure of operations versus first-tier suppliers.The report suggests that businesses can prioritize action and contribute to the 2030 Agenda through the sale of SDG-aligned products and services, including recycled steel, renewable energy, green building, and natural and organic cosmetics.

"17 October 2019: The Seventh Asia-Pacific Urban Forum (APUF-7) has concluded with the establishment of the Penang Platform for Sustainable Urbanization, which seeks to leverage the strengths of cities and urban development organizations to support local, regional and national governments in achieving the SDGs and New Urban Agenda (NUA) in the region.The Forum, which convened in Penang, Malaysia, from 15-17 October, emphasized the critical role of the region’s cities in achieving the SDGs, given that they generate over 80% of gross domestic product (GDP) in many Asia-Pacific countries. The conference also acknowledged that cities face increasing demands on public services, infrastructure and the environment, given that, in 2019, the Asia-Pacific region became majority urban for the first time, with more than 2.3 billion people living in cities and an additional 1.2 billion people expected to live in them by 2050.With proper urban planning and innovative, local thinking, cities can be the solution.Addressing the Forum, UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif said cities must be better planned, managed and financed for improved resilience and to meet citizens’ needs.  Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji, said urban centers are taking on a larger role in achieving the SDGs, particularly with respect to climate change. He noted that, with proper urban planning and innovative, local thinking, cities “can be the solution.”The Penang Platform focuses on: collaboration to accelerate SDG implementation in cities; integrating the use of tools, models, research and evidence of good practices; transforming access to innovative urban financing sources through new partnerships; and increasing political sustainable urbanization commitments.During the first phase of the Platform from 2019 to 2023, the Asia-Pacific Mayor’s Academy is being established to support new mayors with access to expertise, greater awareness of regional resources, a support network to help with urban sustainability initiatives, and annual intensive “boot camps” and ongoing peer-learning.APUF-7 also registered voluntary commitments for the first time, which are expected to deliver concrete results by 2023 and will help increase investments and impactful initiatives for implementing sustainable urban development in the region. The online voluntary commitment platform will remain open until 15 December 2019.‘The Future of Asian and Pacific Cities’ report 2019, launched at the Forum, cites natural resource management, climate change, disaster risk and rising inequalities as major urban development challenges in the region. The Asia-Pacific Urban Forum, held every four years since 1993 and organized by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and UN-Habitat, is the largest regional gathering of urban stakeholders. [UN-Habitat Press Release on Opening of Conference] [ESCAP Press Release on Opening of Conference] [ESCAP News Story on Penang Platform for Sustainable Urbanization] [UN-Habitat Press Release on Following Closure of Forum] [APUF-7 Website]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1
"SDG progress has become harder to assess without data on situations facing persons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a UN report. The report of the UN Secretary-General on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/75/187), issued on 20 July 2020, presents the “imperative” that disability inclusion be incorporated in crisis response, recovery and building back better.The Secretary-General notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened inequalities that were present before the crisis and exposed “the extent of exclusion” faced by persons with disabilities. It also aggravates the multidimensional challenges they face. The report recalls that seven SDG targets make explicit reference to persons with disabilities.The report notes that only 3% of countries have data on persons with disabilities experiencing discrimination. Overall, “the lack of reliable, timely and comparable data related to persons with disabilities further challenges the ability to assess the progress or lack thereof” towards the SDGs.However, the report suggests that an increasing number of countries and international agencies are working to collect disability data, including through new, innovative methodologies. For example, smartphone-based crowdsourcing can provide information on the accessibility of physical spaces around the world. Another positive trend is greater discussion of persons within disabilities within the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) prepared for each session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).Among its recommendations, the report highlights a “twin-track approach” that pairs greater inclusion with targeted effort to address the specific needs of members of marginalized groups. It also recommends that innovations emerging from the COVID-19 era – such as telecommuting and remote learning – be “pursued in a way that helps to advance social inclusion.”Finally, the Secretary-General urges efforts in line with the Inclusive Data Charter adopted in 2018 in order to “compile disability data on a systematic and regular basis globally, regionally and nationally to track progress, identify gaps and facilitate policymaking.” Moreover, broader use of data collection using the Washington Group’s disability questions could be promoted, the report suggests.The report concludes with a set of actions for Member States to consider, in order to mainstream disability and protect the rights of persons with disabilities in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the 2030 Agenda.

In his report, Guterres says he will ensure climate change remains a priority on the international agenda. He will do so by convening high-level platforms for countries to present more ambitious plans; pushing financial actors to accelerate the transition from the grey to the green economy; facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogues; and coordinated UN system engagement.Further, the report elaborates on outcomes under the 12 themes of the Summit, and ten priority areas for 2020, namely:securing more ambitious commitments from major emitters, with the goal of reducing emissions by at least 45% by 2030 in line with achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and the SDGs;ensuring all countries come forward with 2050 carbon neutrality commitments;increasing ambition in sectors not fully considered in the past, including nature-based solutions;addressing the social dimension of climate change by ensuring NDCs include a just transition;curtailing current coal capacity and ensuring no new coal power plants are built after 2020;accelerating the transition to 100% renewable energy;accelerating the shift of financial flows, taxing pollution not people, and ensuring access to sustainable finance;stepping-up support for people affected by climate change and transitioning toward a resilient future;delivering on commitments made at the Summit to SIDS and LDCs; andimplementing initiatives aimed at decarbonization of key economic sectors.Presenting the report during the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 25) in Madrid, Spain, Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Action Summit, underscored the need to align policies and systems to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs.

"Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) has released two reports as part of itsEnergizing Finance series, which track 2018 finance for electricity and clean cooking in the countries with lowest energy access, and identify gaps between commitments and disbursements of development finance for energy. The reports find it will not be possible to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) by 2030 without significant increases in committed investment and improvements in investment disbursement delays.SEforALL partnered with the Climate Policy Initiative to publish the report titled, ‘Understanding the Landscape 2020,’ which tracks finance for electricity and clean cooking committed in 2018 to 20 “high impact countries” (HICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, home to over 80% of the world’s population without energy access. The fourth edition of thisannual reportfinds that 789 million people lack access to electricity, and 2.8 billion people lack access to clean cooking. In 2018, only one-third of the annual USD 41 billion investment required to achieve universal residential electrification and less than 1% of the annual USD 4.5 billion required to achieve universal clean cooking access by 2030 were tracked in the HICs. Additionally, the report notes, investments are not flowing to the countries with the greatest need, nor are energy access investments channeled to the right energy solutions. Investment in fossil fuel-generated electricity increased in 2018, with fossil fuels accounting for the largest portion of electricity finance commitments to HICs for the first time in six years. Overall, the energy access investment portfolio continued to be dominated by a small number of large projects, and capital providers and private sector investments remained elusive in the clean cooking sector. The report concludes with recommendations for policies, regulatory frameworks, institutions, instruments, and business models to accelerate efforts.SEforALL’s second report titled, ‘Missing the Mark 2020,’ identifies the gaps between commitments and disbursements of development finance for energy, as tracked in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System database between 2013-2018. The report finds that although disbursements for energy in HICs have increased at a faster pace than overall development finance disbursements, energy finance disbursements lagged significantly behind commitments of USD 52 billion. Furthermore, aggregate disbursements during the period reviewed of USD 32 billion were insufficient to cover even one year of the annual investment of USD 45 billion necessary to achieve SDG 7 energy access targets. While delays in disbursement have declined since 2002, the report finds delays remained substantial due to cumbersome administrative processes, a lack of capacity among donors and implementing entities, and design flaws that hindered project execution. The report provides recommendations for donors, development finance institutions, and national policymakers to accelerate disbursements and improve the efficacy of energy projects in HICs.

"6 September 2019: The Global Mechanism of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has published a briefing note and manual to advance gender equality in land degradation neutrality in (LDN) interventions.TheBriefing Notetitled, ‘Land Degradation Neutrality: Interventions to Foster Gender Equality,’ discusses the role that policymakers and implementers can play in integrating gender equality into LDN-based initiatives. The note emphasizes the need to avoid deepening inequalities or marginalizing women’s rights and calls for:gender-equal participation in land and natural resource governance at the national and landscape levels through inclusive national-level coordination and community and women-led participation, planning and leadership;strengthening legal protections for land rights of vulnerable groups including women;equalizing the access, use and control over land, forests and natural resources through better access to technology, services and resources, as well as gender-responsive land and natural resource use and management; andclosing the gender gap and moving toward evidence-based interventions by,inter alia,tracking the land rights of women and men, pairing land degradation socio-economic indicators, and disaggregating data, gender targets and baselines by sex.The Global Mechanism, with UN-Women and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), also launched a ‘Manual for Gender-responsive LDN Transformative Projects and Programmes,’ which provides guidance to Parties on integrating gender issues and promoting gender equality when designing LDN projects. TheManualaims to equip project developers with guidance for mainstreaming gender perspectives into LDN projects and programmes throughout their lifecycle, and help governments determine how best to integrate gender perspectives.The briefing note and the manual were launched at a side event to the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the UNCCD in New Delhi, India.

"25 September 2019: The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) published a report exploring the potential on green hydrogen. The report notes that hydrogen represents a “complementary solution that is especially relevant for countries with ambitious climate objectives.”The report titled, ‘Hydrogen: A Renewable Energy Perspective,’ examines the potential of hydrogen fuel for hard-to-decarbonize, energy-intensive industries such as trucks, aviation, shipping and heating. In this context, IRENA’s press release on the report highlights its support for the work of the ‘Getting to Zero Coalition’ to achieve carbon emissions cuts in the global shipping sector by 2030.According to the publication, current and future sourcing options for hydrogen are: “gray” (fossil fuel-based); “blue” (fossil fuel-based production with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)); and “green” (renewables-based). Hydrogen’s decarbonization impact depends on how it is produced. For example, as blue hydrogen is not inherently carbon free, its production requires monitoring and verification and certification to account for non-captured emissions and retention of stored carbon dioxide (CO2).The report finds that there are important synergies between hydrogen and renewable energy and that synergies may exist between green and blue hydrogen deployment such as in economies of scale in hydrogen use or hydrogen logistics. It also finds that the cost of hydrogen supply from renewables has come down in recent years and continues to fall.The publication acknowledges that a hydrogen-based energy transition will not happen overnight, and hydrogen use will target specific applications. It concludes that trade of energy-intensive commodities produced with hydrogen, including “e-fuels” may offer an opportunity to accelerate the uptake or renewables and bring wider economic benefits.The report was launched at a side event, hosted by the World Economic Forum (WEF), in conjunction with theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.

"Benin has joined the list of countries that will report on SDG implementation at the national level during the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).In September 2019 the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)informed governmentsthat a high number of countries had expressed interested in presenting at the 2020 HLPF. She said the ECOSOC Bureau had decided to give priority to first- and second-time presenters, and countries that had already made two presentations were encouraged to wait until a later HLPF.Since then, a few changes have taken place on the list. As of 18 February 2020:Jordan and Monaco are no longer listed to present their second reports;Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;Kenya is listed to give its second report, andBenin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for theintergovernmental reviewsof ECOSOC and the HLPF.The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; andSecond-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNRQ&A documentand theupdated voluntary common reporting guidelines.To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According tothe summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joiningfive other countrieswho have volunteered to prepare national reviews.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"10 October 2019: Over 500 participants considered the theme, ‘Mining in a Changing Climate,’ at the 15th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development (IGF). Delegates discussed ways that mining companies are starting to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from mining operations, as well as how they are learning to adapt to changes in climate and the environment, water scarcity, and increased risk of natural disasters.Participants also considered what mining will look like in the future as digital technology changes the way that work is done, the digital economy changes the way that resources may be taxed, and consumers increasingly seek out ethically-sourced products.The three-day event, which convened from 8-10 October 2019, was organized by the IGF Secretariat and hosted by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the Palais des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. The IGF serves as a global venue for dialogue among 74 member country governments, as well as mining companies and industry associations.During the discussion on mining in a changing climate, participants debated,inter alia: whether regulations are needed to supplement and align voluntary mining company initiatives on climate change; whether new governance arrangements need to be developed at the international level; what incentives can push companies to be more ambitious in their climate initiatives; and whether studies already exist on zero-GHG technologies for mining.Among other issues discussed during the 15th AGM were the following:“Climate-smart” mining and “green mines” that use renewable energy, avoid waste generation, and restore degraded land, for example, by reprocessing mine tailings, and capping old tailings mounds to grow vegetables;Concerns whether producer countries, especially African countries, will be able to derive long-term benefits from the “huge increase” in global demand for minerals used in renewable energy technology, and what can be done to promote ownership models that benefit local communities;Post-mining transition strategies, including for coal regions, which would restore environments damaged by mining activities and provide alternative employment for people in local communities;Gender equality issues, including whether women have opportunities to be involved in national and local-level debates around the impacts of mining, whether they benefit from mining activities, and whether they have avenues to report mining-related problems, including problems of gender-based violence;Development of common standards for responsible mining, including the current Global Tailings Review consultation, which seeks to avoid further disasters such as the collapse of the Brumadinho tailings dam in Brazil in early 2019;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), which may allocate “market-facing countries” the right to tax transactions, potentially reducing the revenue received by producer countries; andEfforts to formalize the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, especially from the perspective of eliminating child labor, promoting decent work, and avoiding mercury emissions from artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM).In addition, the Secretariat presented a draft version of the IGF guidance on environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) for comment, prior to its planned release in February 2020.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has announced that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (Nigeria) and Yoo Myung-hee (Republic of Korea) will advance to the third and final round of the selection process to determine who will succeed Roberto Azevêdo as the next World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General. This result “creates an historic precedent” because it assures that the next Director-General will be the first woman to lead the WTO.WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand), with Chair of the Dispute Settlement Body Dacio Castillo (Honduras) and Chair of the Trade Policy Review Body Harald Aspelund (Iceland), conducted confidential consultations with members from 24 September to 6 October, during which each delegation was asked a single question: “What are your preferences?” Members then submitted their two preferences to the “troika” of facilitators. Addressing a Heads of Delegation meeting on 8 October, Walker said the two candidates had secured “the broadest and deepest support from the membership.”Walker said the third and final round of consultations will take place from 19-27 October “to afford members sufficient time to prepare their positions.” During this time, the troika will hold confidential consultations with WTO members, asking delegations to express a single preference. Based on these preferences, the facilitators “will deliver their assessment on which of the two candidates is most likely to command a consensus of the membership” and become the seventh WTO Director-General. The troika will then present their recommendation to the General Council for a formal decision.On 14 May 2020, Roberto Azevêdo (Brazil)announcedthat he would step down from his post on 31 August. Thefirst phaseof the 2020 Director-General selection process, during whicheight countriesnominated candidates for the position, commenced on 8 June and concluded on 8 July.Thesecond phaseof the selection process, in which the candidates “make themselves known to members,” concluded on 7 September 2020, and thethird phasebegan.As per a 31 July decision by the General Council, thethird and final phaseof the selection process consists of three stages of consultations. Following the first stage, the field of candidates was reduced fromeight to five. In reducing the field of candidates from five to two, WTO members have concluded the second round of consultations.The third stage of consultations “is expected to yield a final consensus candidate.” According to theprocedures for the Director-General selection process, adopted by WTO members in 2002, the key consideration in determining which candidate is likely to achieve consensus is the “breadth of support” each candidate receives from members.

"The Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) has established a regional office focused on adaptation issues and projects across Africa. The regional office is hosted by the African Development Bank (AfDB) at its headquarters in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire.GCA Africa will partner with organizations across the continent to scale and accelerate climate adaptation initiatives, focusing on programmes and actions, knowledge acceleration, and capacity building and agenda setting. GCA Africa aims to improve the food security of one billion Sub-Saharan Africans by 2030 through a programme focused on enhancing rural well-being and food security. It will also focus on projects to build youth leadership, leverage nature for more resilient infrastructure, and support communities through water for urban growth and resilience.AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina said the opening of the regional GCA office in Africa marks a major milestone in the AfDB’s push to build climate resilience across the continent. He highlighted the AfDB’s commitment to doubling its financing for climate to USD 25 billion by 2025, with over 50% devoted to adaptation, and said the Bank “will partner with the GCA to mobilize more resources for climate adaptation in Africa.”Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the GCA, highlighted GCA Africa’s role in “responding to the growing demand for strengthening resilience to the impacts of our changing climate” by working with partners to “ensure the most effective adaptation measures are shared and scaled across the continent.”GCA Africa is a regional office of theGlobal Center on Adaptation, which works as a solutions broker to accelerate action and support for adaptation. Hosted by the Netherlands, GCA engages in high-level policy activities, research, communications, and technical assistance to government and the private sector.

"The Global Environment Facility (GEF) approved a USD 2 million grant for a partnership on nature-based infrastructure. The project will seek to increase investment in nature-based infrastructure that can help adapt to the impacts of climate change.The project, which wasannouncedon 31 July 2020, will use financial modelling and climate change projections to establish the business case for investing in nature. The project partners report that they will provide decision-makers with comprehensive, system-wide valuations of natural assets, reflecting not only capital and operating costs, but also co-benefits from carbon sequestration, air purification, protection against water scarcity, and climate change adaptation. They will also provide cost comparisons with grey infrastructure alternatives.Many decision-makers do not have the tools to compare green or hybrid infrastructure solutions with alternatives when making decisions about flood control, food security, coastal protection, water conservation, and wastewater treatment. The project partners highlight the increased importance of such information as countries plan their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and work toward global climate change, biodiversity, and other goals and frameworks.The initiative is supported by the GEF-managed Special Climate Change Fund. It is co-financed by the MAVA Foundation. The implementing agency is the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) will execute the initiative, which will use IISD’s modelling tool for analyzing the costs of externalities of infrastructure projects (Sustainable Asset Valuation, orSAVi). Unlike traditional financial valuations of infrastructure projects, SAVi places a financial value on economic, social, and environmental risks and shows how these risks affect the financial performance of infrastructure projects and portfolios across their life cycles.The project will use data from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, and will include a public online database on the valuation and performance of nature-based infrastructure. The project will support the Global Commission on Adaptation’s call to scale up action on nature-based solutions for adaptation. [IISD press release]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
"The Doha Amendment, which establishes the Kyoto Protocol’s 2013-2020 second commitment period, has received the required number of ratifications to enter into force. Once in force, the emission reduction commitments of participating developed countries and economies in transition (EITs) become legally binding.The Doha Amendment’s entry into force, a UNFCCC press release notes, is “critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.” Its entry into force also means that “accounting of the Kyoto Protocol’s second phase can go ahead as anticipated and that the Kyoto Protocol’s compliance committee can fully fulfill its legal functions.”Since our lastupdatein July 2019, 15 countries have ratified the Doha Amendment, bringing the total number of ratifications to 145. The Amendment will formally enter into force within 90 days from 1 October 2020, when the 144th instrument of acceptance was received by the Depositary.The Amendment’s entry into force is critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.Angola submitted its instrument of acceptance on 22 September 2020; Bolivia on 17 September 2020; Egypt on 3 February 2020; El Salvador on 18 September 2019; Georgia on 16 June 2020; Ghana on 24 September 2020; Guatemala on 15 October 2019; Jamaica on 1 October 2020; Jordan on 3 January 2020; Nigeria on 2 October 2020; Niue on 10 December 2019; North Macedonia on 18 October 2019; Senegal on 27 May 2020; Sierra Leone on 15 June 2020; and Zambia on 22 August 2019.The Amendment sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 18% compared to 1990 levels for participating countries. This, according to the UNFCCC, “represents an increase from an average reduction of 5% compared to 1990 levels” during the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period from 2008-2012.“The Doha Amendment’s entry into force is a strong signal of a unified, multilateral commitment to address climate change,” said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. She noted that it represents political commitment to pre-2020 action, which, she said, is necessary to build trust ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.The entry into force of the Doha Amendment occurs at a time when global emissions are likely to result in an increase of global average temperatures of 3°C above preindustrial levels, the UNFCCC warns. Therefore, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) countries are expected to submit in 2020 remain critical for reaching the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement – to keep global warming “well below” 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.The Doha Amendment was adopted by Decision 1/CMP.8 at the eighth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 8), in Doha, Qatar, in 2012.

"12 July 2019: UN-Water has launched a policy brief on the topic of water and climate change that presents a case for taking an integrated approach to climate change and water management, in anticipation of greater variability in the water cycle, periods of water scarcity, and increasing competition from various quarters for water resources. Overall, it argues for managing water through the lens of climate resilience.The 20-page Water and Climate Policy Brief as launched at a side event organized during the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The brief anticipates that the impacts of climate change will be felt in the increased demand for water for energy, agriculture, industry, and human consumption. Making reasonable trade-offs will be essential; thus, the UN consortium calls for policies that will ensure the representation, participation, behavioral change, and accountability of all stakeholders, as well as adaptation plans that will assist lower-income populations and those who are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. The policy brief further calls for more investment in producing better hydrological data, strengthening institutions and governance of water resources, conducting risk assessments, sharing knowledge, educating water users, and building capacity for better water management.Water is both an enabling and a limiting factor in mitigating and adapting to climate change.At the global and regional levels, UN-Water recommends,inter alia: getting a broader set of national and local government agencies and ministries to participate in the UNFCCC, such as those from water, health, energy, and agriculture sectors; setting global priorities for climate-resilient water and sanitation interventions that will serve the most vulnerable populations, including in areas where there is large-scale human displacement; and ensuring that climate discussions and agreements recognize the role of water in mitigating the impacts of climate change. UN-Water also calls on existing and new climate funds to support resilience building through improved water governance and management.At the national and sub-national levels, UN-Water recommends,inter alia: updating existing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national adaptation plans (NAPs) and other climate-related strategies to incorporate risk-based approaches to water provision and management practices that align with climate targets where appropriate; fostering dialogue among various ministries; and supporting academic research into low-regret, climate-resilient and context-specific water and sanitation infrastructure and technology.The policy brief concludes that water is both an enabling and a limiting factor in mitigating and adapting to climate change.

"August 2019: A group of individuals have come together to launch The Climate Emergency Fund to avoid a worst-case scenario and restore a safe climate. The Fund will provide grants to climate activists to support their efforts in addressing the “climate emergency.”The Climate Emergency Fund website states that the current climate emergency requires “large-scale disruption and nonviolent civil disobedience.” The Fund argues for a new paradigm that phases out fossil fuel infrastructure and phases in non-fossil energy sources and removes carbon from the atmosphere. To achieve this shift, the Fund argues that the disruption of everyday life and perceived normal reality “is necessary to create a conversation on the climate and ecological crisis” and force needed policy change.The fund takes a non-violent, disruptive approach to the climate emergency.The Climate Emergency Fund Board of Directors includes Trevor Neilson, Rory Kennedy and Sarah Ezzy. The Advisory Board includes Aileen Getty, Bill McKibben, David Wallace-Wells, Katie Eder and Margaret Klein Salamon. In a story onMedium,Neilson explained that the fund will “catalyze hundreds – if not thousands – of new climate activist groups.” He said the fund takes a “non-violent, disruptive approach” to the climate emergency.The Climate Emergency Fund provides funding to individuals and organizations that demonstrate the “intention and capability of disrupting with urgency the inadequate and immoral gradual approach governments around the world are taking to address the climate emergency.” The Fund provides three levels of grants based on the entity’s size and maturity. Level 1 grants receive funding for printed materials, bullhorns and other supplies for grassroots climate activists. Level 2 organizational development funding grants are for groups that have grown beyond the start-up phase and are working to create a more sophisticated or permanent structure. Level 3 provides operational funding for climate activists whose organizations are mature and need support for office space, salaries, housing stipends, marketing and communications and other needs.

"A civil society coalition has outlined proposals on the role of the UN’s financing for development (FfD) process in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter is addressed to the President of the UN Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) and the co-facilitators of preparations for ECOSOC’s 2020 session of the Financing for Development Forum, which was recently postponed.The letter from the Civil Society FfD Group calls for stepping up multilateral action under the UN, and for steps that “break with normalcy” in line with the UN Secretary-General’s call to move beyond “usual tools” to address the crisis.The coalition proposes refocusing 2020 FfD negotiations on a process to address impacts of the pandemic.It urges an “ambitious UN/FfD-centered process” to assess the global crisis surrounding the pandemic and agree on responses. The Group envisions the process leading to an International Economic Reconstruction and Systemic Reform Summit under the UN, either later in 2020 or in early 2021.The Group proposes that the FfD follow-up process could help raise ambition to remove barriers to socio-economic transformation and promote reforms of global economic frameworks to realign them with human rights, gender justice, decent work, and sustainable development. This would help the international community unlock the means of implementation (MOI) needed to realize the 2030 Agenda.The Group makes six specific proposals:Immediately initiate informal discussions under the leadership of the ECOSOC President and Bureau, on the need for an FfD-centered crisis process;Refocus the second phase of the 2020 outcome negotiations on the rationale, modalities, and agenda for such a process, including possible Conference hosting arrangements;Focus negotiations on addressing key challenges and modalities of preparations for each FfD action area, including any necessary mandates to the Inter-Agency Task Force and FfD Institutional Stakeholders;Request the the Inter-Agency Task Force on FfD to initiate preparations for a special report for the UN/FfD-centered crisis process;Begin online preparations immediately while ensuring that all Member States, including the least developed countries (LDCs), are able to participate effectively and on equal footing, and ensuring full transparency and adequate civil society participation; andFinalize consultations and negotiations in person as soon as physical meetings are possible.TheCivil Society FfD Grouprepresents a wide range of organizations, federations and networks from diverse regions and constituencies around the world, including the Women’s Working Group on FfD. [Civil Society FfD Group Letter]",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In advance of a global meeting on sustainable wood production, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and other forestry stakeholders called for changing the way the world harvests and trades wood for timber, paper and other uses to tackle deforestation, conserve biodiversity and combat climate change, in line with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The discussion took place within the Sustainable Wood for a Sustainable World Initiative (SW4SW).In parallel to the China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) EXPO Forest & Wood Products 2019, over 100 forestry experts convened in Nanning, China, to discuss options for promoting sustainable wood trade and production. FAO, the Government of China and the China National Forest Products Industry Association organized the expert discussion, which took place from 23-25 November 2019.Participants discussed measures to promote sustainable wood trade and production through commitments to legality and raising awareness of end consumers. They supported tackling illegal wood in markets and increasing the market value for sustainable products and discussed opportunities for promoting positive linkages between sustainable wood value chains and poverty reduction, sustainable landscapes and sustainable economic growth. They also recognized the importance of exchanging technical expertise, increasing South-South cooperation and strengthening producers’ capacity to harvest wood sustainably and gain access to markets that support and promote legal and sustainable wood supplies.Sustainable wood “means less deforestation, cleaner air and water, more stable land and better livelihoods.”FAO Senior Forestry Officer, Thais Linhares-Juvenal, highlighted sustainable wood as a driver of sustainable rural development and “the basis of a sustainable bioeconomy.” She explained sustainable wood “means less deforestation, cleaner air and water, more stable land and better livelihoods, including for rural populations and indigenous communities.” Linhares-Juvenal stressed the importance of increasing attention on sustainable wood trade and on trade practices that limit illegal wood in markets. [SDG Knowledge Hub Guest Article on Greening the Wood Industry]FAO, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the World Bank and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) formed the SW4SW Initiative in 2018 to “reconcile the international demand for wood with social, economic and environmental needs.” The Initiative aims to strengthen sustainable wood value chains by enhancing their social, economic and environmental benefits from production through to consumption and contributing to achieving SDGs 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17.

"A policy brief by the Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) Cities Biodiversity Center (CBC) and 13 other organizations calls on governments and the climate community to address food and agriculture as a key driver of land-use change and the climate crisis, by taking measures to reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The policy brief titled, ‘An Urgent Call to Action to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Food and Agriculture,’ was launched on 4 December 2019 at the 25th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).By the text, the livestock sector accounts for at least 14.5% of global GHG emissions, while population growth and its associated increases in urbanization and per-capita consumption of animal products will lead to a 70% increase by 2050. To reduce the consumption of food from animal sources, which will be key to meeting the goals under the Paris Agreement on climate change, the brief highlights the need for a multi-pronged approach by governments, researchers, civil society organizations, educational institutions and other stakeholders.Over-consumption and over-production of animal-based foods “remains largely absent from international climate negotiations and commitments.”The publication notes that while transforming current destructive, industrial and unsustainable food systems is essential to tackling the climate and biodiversity crises, over-consumption and over-production of animal-based foods “remains largely absent from international climate negotiations and commitments.”To address this, the publication recommends:UNFCCC acknowledge the largest contributors to climate change in food and agriculture and provide technical assistance for parties to integrate food and agriculture into nationally determined contributions (NDCs);Syncing global climate and development policies to promote sustainable diets and systems of food production to achieve accelerated emissions reductions and the SDGs;Governments take “bold steps” to internalize the costs of livestock production and end tax and other incentives for growing feed crops;Actors to host dialogues between different governmental departments (such as Agriculture, Environment, Climate, Forests and Health) to ensure that policies are aligned and not jeopardized by regulations in other departments; andGovernments shift procurement to encourage and demonstrate low GHG pathways.Other suggested policies include shifting dietary choices, reducing food loss and waste, and improving land-use management and food security.

"The NewClimate Institute has published a report that analyzes the nuances of net-zero targets in order to better enable the identification of truly ambitious actors and offers recommendations for increasing target transparency.The report titled, ‘Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets,’ lauds the accelerating momentum for net-zero targets, noting that the number of net-zero pledges from cities, regions, and companies has about doubled since late 2019. In total, regions, cities, and companies with net-zero targets now represent over 880 million residents, 24.9 million employees, and 10 gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.However, the report warns, nuances in target implementation approaches can determine the extent to which an actor’s target contributes to deep decarbonization. These nuances have implications for the additionality of the impact, the integrity of the actor’s claimed outcome, and the extent to which the approaches support or hinder efforts to solve decarbonization challenges.The report categorizes the nuances according to whether they target the direct reduction of emissions, claim to neutralize emissions through offsetting, or support carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. For example, under the direct reduction of emissions category, the report highlights a broad range of approaches for claiming the neutralization of electricity-related emissions and for supporting the reduction of supply chain and out-of-boundary emissions.The report analyzes the impacts of different types of renewable energy delivery approaches and the risks and opportunities associated with the claiming of offsets in the post-2020 global governance framework under the Paris Agreement on climate change.As uncertainties persist related to methodologies for calculating the climate impact of CO2 removal, the report recommends that these methodologies not be considered as equivalent to direct GHG reductions in claiming neutralization and that actors specify targets for emission reductions and emission removals separately.The report finds that transparency enables accountability, unraveling ambiguity to assist the public in understanding and encourage an actor’s ambition. As transparency enables constructive dialogue about challenges faced, it results in greater solution-oriented ambition than making net-zero claims based in opaque accounting practices, it notes. Conversely, non-transparent net-zero targets can mislead stakeholders about environmental impact, resulting in decisions and behavior that can cause an increase in GHG emissions.The report concludes by listing ten criteria for net-zero target transparency, including recommendations to chart a decarbonization pathway with interim targets and to commit to a timeline to revise and ratchet ambition.The NewClimate Institute supports research and implementation of international action against climate change by generating and sharing knowledge on international climate negotiations, tracking climate action, climate and development, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.In the last year, countries includingChina,Japan, theEU, and theRepublic of Korea, as well asclose to 200 companiesand theNet-Zero Asset Owner Alliancewere among the actors to pledge or announce significant strides towards net-zero targets. [Publication:Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets] [NewClimate Institute Press Release]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The Transparency, Accountability, and Participation (TAP) Network and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) have partnered to develop a resource on implementing and monitoring SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) in a country after it has presented a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The initiative follows requests from governments and others for guidance on the post-VNR period.The resource is expected to be published in mid-2020. It will focus on best practices and challenges, as well as opportunities for countries repeatedly conducting VNRs.As a first step to developing the resource, TAP and UNDP have invited input through anonline surveyto collect experiences and lessons learned on post-VNR activities related to SDG 16. The survey titled, ‘Strengthening Post-VNR Best Practices on SDG16,’ targets stakeholders including governments, youth, civil society, businesses, national statistics offices (NSOs), human rights institutions, and UN agencies. It asks respondents,inter alia:whether the latest VNR from the national government included recommendations or next steps on SDG 16;what actions the government has taken to implement SDG 16 and related principles since delivering its last VNR, and progress and challenges in this regard;whether and how the government has engaged other stakeholders in the activities following up on the VNR;how the VNR and related process have supported action to implement SDG 16;how the government is preparing to report on SDG 16 in a subsequent VNR; andwhat kind of support the government and other stakeholders need to follow up on the previous VNRAnonline consultationis scheduled for 10 March 2020, to be followed by additional consultations in the lead-up to the July 2020 session of the UN High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF).

"The UN system launched a “one-minute survey” to elicit aspirations for the future from people around the world. The survey is part of a consultation process that will inform the UN’s 75th anniversary in September 2020.The UN describes the process as a “global reality check” and the “largest, most inclusive conversation on the role of global cooperation in building a better future for all.” It aims to gather the views of, in particular, youth and other groups not already engaged with the UN.One format the conversation will take is a survey launched on 1 January 2020, consisting of five questions:Overall, do you think that people in 2045 will be better off, worse off, or the same as you are today? (Choose one.)If you picture the world you want in 25 years, what three things would you most want to see? (Choices include “better management of international migration,” “more environmental protection,” “more employment opportunities,” “greater equality between men and women” and “better access to healthcare.”)Which of these global trends do you think will most affect our future? (Choices include risks related to terrorism, health and new technologies; climate change and environmental issues; nuclear weapons; forced displacement; and breakdown of relations between countries.)How important – or not – is it for countries to work together to manage the above trends? (Five-point scale from “Not important at all” to “Essential.”)What would you advise the UN Secretary-General to do to address these global trends? (Write up to 140 characters.)Users are informed that responses “will help improve international management of these trends, and put us in a better position to meet our aspirations for a brighter global future in 2045 – when the United Nations will turn 100.” In addition to the one-minute survey, the UN75 dialogues will include opinion polling in 50 countries, and artificial intelligence (AI) sentiment analysis including through social media, in 70 countries. The resulting data will be provided to inform national and international policies and debate, according to the UN.The UN Secretary-General will present the ideas generated by the process during a high-level event to mark the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020. The theme of this event will be, ‘The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism,’ asagreedby UN Member States in June 2019.

"The World Trade Organization (WTO), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and Business Twenty (B20) Saudi Arabia have issued a joint statement that shines a spotlight on “the diminishing availability of trade finance.”The 9 July 2020 statement warns that gaps between current trade finance supply and demand may impede trade’s ability to support COVID-19 recovery efforts. The organizations emphasize that a return to trade-led growth relies on the creation of enabling conditions for businesses to import, export, and service international markets. Trade finance, the statement stresses, is a critical element of such an enabling environment.The statement urges public and private actors to collaborate, and calls for action to address the trade finance shortage. The statement outlines four action areas where the public and private sectors should work together to help fill the gap:Enable a rapid transition to paperless trading;Exchange views on how regulatory authorities could help mitigate constraints to essential trade finance deployment;Share risk to support trade finance; andScale development bank schemes to provide risk mitigation and liquidity for trade finance transactions.Highlighting the scale of the finance gap, the statement points to an ICC estimate that projects that up to USD 5 trillion in financing may be required to support a rapid rebound in global trade flows. Acknowledging that the private sector is the main provider of trade finance, the statement also recognizes “the many positive emergency measures that many central banks, governments, development banks and regulators have taken since” the pandemic began. These actions, the statement notes, have helped stabilize trade finance markets.The WTO, ICC, and B20 also welcome thejoint statementissued on 1 July by heads of several multilateral development banks (MDBs), who highlighted recent financial commitments and pledged to increase action. However, more action is needed, and the WTO, ICC, and B20 express concern that the trade finance gap “will have a disproportionate effect” on micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and businesses in emerging economies and least developed countries (LDCs), which have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19.According to WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo, while the statement complements other recent WTO initiatives to highlight the importance of supporting trade finance, especially amid the twin health and economic crises, “failing to address the trade finance shortfall will seriously undermine ongoing efforts to give trade the boost it needs to help global economic recovery.” The WTO press release also notes that that the statement and joint call for action have origins in a WTO Trade Dialogues meeting with private sector actors held in May 2020.B20 is the official Group of 20 (G20) dialogue with the business community.

"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has coordinated the publication of a multi-organization high-level compilation of key climate science findings which states that atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are at record levels despite a temporary decline caused by the COVID-19 lock-down.Building on the2019 edition, the report titled, ‘United in Science 2020,’ brings together the latest climate science updates fromWMO, Global Carbon Project (GCP), UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNESCO-IOC), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), UN EnvironmentProgramme(UNEP), and the UK Met Office. Each organization contributed a chapter.The publicationhighlights the negative and irreversible impacts of rising global emissions and climate change on oceans and seas, ecosystems and economies, water resources, and human well-being and health. The report also reviews how COVID-19 has hindered global monitoring of climate change and finds that, despite a temporary decline, global emissions are on track to return to pre-pandemic levels.Key findings address emissions trends and current and projected impacts of climate change. The WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch states that although sustained reductions in emissions are required to achieve the targets established by the Paris Agreement on climate change, concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) continued to increase in 2019 and 2020, with overall 2020 emissions decreases leading to only a small reduction in the annual increase of the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs.GCP finds that emissions growth slowed to 1% per year in the 2010s, down from 3% annual growth in the 2000s, but warns that declining annual emissions occurring in the early 2010s later increased.WMO and the UK Met Office note that the 2016-2020 average global mean surface temperature will be among the warmest five-year periods on record, 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. The organizations warn that there is a 24% chance that in the five-year period 2020-2023 at least one year could exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Although daily global fossil CO2 emissions fell by 17% during peak pandemic lock-down in April 2020, GCP finds that average 2020 CO2 emissions will only fall by 4-9% compared to 2019.The report includes overviews from the IPCC and WMO on the impact of climate change on oceans, the cryosphere, and water resources. It also reviews UNEP’s tenthEmissions Gap Report,which found that annual cuts in global emissions from 2020-2030 would have to be nearly 3% to achieve a 2°C target and over 7% to limit warming to 1.5°C, equal to the combined emissions of the six largest emitters.UNESCO-IOC and WMO caution that hindrances to climate change monitoring in 2020 will introduce gaps in historical time series needed to monitor climate variability, change, and associated impacts, with long-term potential effects on climate trend data collection and analysis.

"In Namibia, a clear national policy direction and a national agenda – the Namibia Vision 2030 and the e-Government strategy – provided the focus and alignment needed to deliver an interoperable national population registration system. The case study on Namibia is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.According to the case study, Namibia has a fully integrated civil registration and identity management system that registers, processes, and updates the identity information of citizens, permanent residents, and refugees – the National Population Registration System (NPRS). The NPRS was created by combining various databases that held different types of personal information linked by a unique identification number (UIN).The publication notes that, even though Namibia still faces challenges in ensuring that marriage and divorce registrations are complete, major progress was made when birth and death registration became a key prerequisite for offering social grants. This tactic allowed Namibian authorities to incentivize the demand side of the registration process.The authors highlight that adopting information and communication technology (ICT) was essential to building the NPRS, as it helped integrate and launch electronic birth and death notification platforms. The case study underscores that, if adopted correctly and applied to redesigned business processes, ICT can deliver an overarching and interoperable population register that serves an effective tool for delivering high-impact services for governance and public administration. The publication cautions that legal frameworks and technological advancements must be kept in sync as much as possible, despite the fast pace of technology innovations.In Namibia, births and deaths are registered using notifications from the innovative e-birth and e-death notification platforms, which are linked to the NPRS and hosted at health facilities, police mortuaries and civil registration offices. The publication explains that the NPRS is the main building block of the interoperability framework as it uses the National Data Exchange Service Bus interoperability data layer, which allows it to link the population register with functional registers that the government and the private sector run, making it easier to share data and verify identity data.By digitizing civil registration business processes and setting up a database architecture that connects different databases, the Namibian government ensured that they all use the same identity data stored in the civil register, enabling fraud prevention long associated with the financial benefits that people get when registering vital events.Thepublicationtitled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies:Armenia,Ecuador,Kyrgyzstan,NetherlandsandPeru. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

"Finland has communicated its long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategy (LEDS) to the UNFCCC. Finland’s LEDS charts scenarios and impact assessments to achieve its 2035 carbon neutrality target, and reviews longer-term emissions reduction and removal opportunities by 2050.The LEDS assesses Finland’s emissions reduction potential and needs by sector in three scenarios concerning the country’s 2035 carbon neutrality target. The reference scenario reviews development that would be achievable with current policy measures in place. It determines that carbon neutrality would not be possible until 2050, and even then only by leveraging 30 MtCO2eq of land use net sinks.The ‘Continuous Growth’ scenario achieves an 87.5% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The corresponding target under the ‘Savings’ scenario achieves 90% GHG emission reductions. Both achieve carbon neutrality in 2035, and exclude the land-use sector from calculations. Neither scenario sets carbon-negative targets beyond 2035, rather they allow this level “to be determined by the size of the net carbon sink of the land use sector.” The Continuous Growth and Savings scenarios differ in their underlying technology assumptions, most significantly the viability of carbon capture and storage (CCS), as well as increases in energy efficiency and sustainable biorefinery production. The difference in the scenarios is also accounted for by differing assumptions on the structures of industry, society, and the economy as a whole.The LEDS analyzes the emissions reduction potential and needs of the energy, industry, transport, waste, and land use sectors. The Strategy does not specifically identify the sectors to which emission reductions should be allocated, nor does it include quantitative analysis of specific policies needed to achieve the 2035 and 2050 targets. These, it states, will be decided in 2020-2021 as part of the country’s process of drafting the Climate and Energy Strategy, the Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan, the roadmap for fossil-free transport, and the climate programme for the land use sector. Rather than consider emissions reductions from a regional or social justice perspective, Finland’s LEDS bases its calculations on the premise that emission reduction costs should be minimized across the country.Finland originally submitted its LEDS to the European Commission in March 2020 to comply with the EU’s requirement that each member State prepare and submit to the Commission its comprehensive long-term strategy by the start of 2020.According to the Paris Agreement on climate change, “all Parties should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies” to the UNFCCC by 2020.Benin(in French),Canada,Costa Rica, theCzech Republic, theEU,Fiji,France,Germany,Japan, theMarshall Islands,Mexico,Portugal,Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, theUS, theUK, andUkrainehave already submitted their LEDS. [Publication:Finland’s Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy] [UNFCCC Long-Term Strategies Website]By Gabriel Gordon-Harper, Thematic Expert on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"September 2019: The Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) issued a working paper that explores how climate actions contained in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) connect to the 17 SDGs. The paper demonstrates that NDC actions foster synergies with national development priorities that reflect the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Authored by Adis Dzebo, Hannah Janetschek, Clara Brandi and Gabriela Iacobuta, thepapertitled, ‘Connections Between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda: The Case for Policy Coherence,’ illuminates potential overlaps, gaps and conflicts between the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda to increase policy coherence of plans and strategies, and improve effectiveness of implementation of the two agreements.Evidence of effective orchestration between NDCs and the SDGs is largely absent at the national level.NDCs are considered the “primary means” for governments to indicate to the international community their specific steps for tackling climate change and achieving the Paris Agreement. The SEI working paper reveals that activities proposed in countries’ NDCs most prominently cover six SDGs:SDG 2 (zero hunger);SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);SDG 15 (life on land); andSDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).In addition, several climate activities contribute “to a limited extent” to the following SDGs:SDG 3 (good health and well-being);SDG 4 (quality education);SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure);SDG 13 (climate action); andSDG 14 (life below water).The paper further notes that some SDGs are “far less connected” with NDC activities, and focus mainly on the social and political issues. These are: SDG 1 (no poverty); SDG 5 (gender equality); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). For instance, the authors reveal that only 2% of total NDC activities address SDG 1, and they call on policymakers to take into account the adverse effects of climate change on poor households, such as measures that can affect the poor by raising prices through energy or carbon taxes, or by using more expensive technologies for electricity production.The authors also find that evidence of effective orchestration between NDCs and the SDGs is largely absent at the national level. Per them, an integrated approach offers greater leverage for advancing the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, as it simultaneously allows governments to step up ambition and impact, and to avoid costly and counterproductive trade-offs. In order to improve policy coherence, they suggest that countries should design their future National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDSs) in ways that align with their NDCs and complement NDC activities, and vice versa. They outline the need to avoid uncoordinated “and costly” duplication of efforts, and to more closely align climate actions with the SDGs in NDCs. They also call on countries to learn from each other’s approaches to policy planning, budgeting, monitoring and reporting.

"The European Commission has adopted a plan focusing on the design and production for a circular economy, ensuring that resources used stay in the EU economy for as long as possible. The plan aims to reduce the EU’s consumption footprint, double its circular material use rate, and contribute to economic decarbonization by reducing the EU’s carbon and material footprint.TheCircular Economy Action Plan for a Cleaner and More Competitive Europe, which is central to theEuropean Green Deal, seeks to ensure that the economy is fit for a green future and strengthen competitiveness while protecting the environment. It introduces legislative and non-legislative measures and target areas where action at the EU level brings added value.More specifically, the Circular Economy Action Plan details measures to:make sustainable products the norm in the EU, including, for example, the restriction of single-use products and ensuring that products on the EU market are designed to last longer, are easier to reuse, repair, and recycle, and incorporate recycled material as much as possible;empower consumers through access to reliable information about products at the point of sale, including on their life span;focus on sectors that use the most resources and have the potential for high circularity, including electronics and information and communications technology (ICT), batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, and food; andensure less waste by transforming it into high-quality secondary resources and implementing actions to minimize EU waste exports and tackle illegal shipments.Applying ambitious circular economy measures in Europe can increase the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP) by an additional 0.5% by 2030, creating around 700,000 new jobs, according to aEuropean Commission press release.The Action Plan includes measures to mobilize private financing in support of the circular economy through EU financial instruments, such asInvestEU. It also proposes the launch of a global circular economy alliance to explore starting a discussion on a possible international agreement on natural resource management.

"The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) has published a policy brief that addresses chemicals of concern in products, and efforts to minimize their adverse effects on human health and the environment. The policy brief titled, ‘Understanding Chemicals in Products,’ is a contribution from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded project on ‘Global Best Practices on Emerging Chemical Policy Issues of Concern under SAICM.’The policy brief notes that transparency of information about chemicals in global supply chains has been an emerging policy issue since 2009, leading to, for example, the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Chemicals in Products (CiP) programme, which focuses on the textiles, toys, electronics and building materials sectors. In 2015, SAICM welcomed CiP and proposed cooperative actions to address information gaps, focusing on the four sectors as documentation of hazardous chemicals often does not exist or is not available outside supply chains. According to SAICM, information exchange helps identify and address chemicals of concern in products, particularly for manufacturers, retailers and consumers.Chemicals of concern intoysoften enter the lifecycle during plastic production, painting and coating, or through recycled materials. Exposure can result in long-term health effects for children, interfering with the hormone system or learning abilities. Specific chemicals of concern include persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from recycled plastic, cadmium in batteries and lead paint, among others.Electronicscontain valuable materials such as metals, which make recycling attractive. Reuse and repair are also common, particularly for high-value products such as medical equipment. However, during the end-of-life and production stages, e-waste is often shipped to developing countries where workers recovering resources of value are exposed to toxic substances. Chemicals of concern include flame retardants in insulation and mercury in switches, as well as  worker exposure to benzene in factories.Potential sources of hazardous chemicals inbuilding materialsinclude use of recycled materials and performance-enhancing substances, which are costly to remove and may affect construction workers and expose inhabitants to indoor pollution. Chemicals in building materials include asbestos, preservative treatment in outdoor wood, mercury in lighting and lead in paint.Potential sources of hazardous chemicals intextilesproduction include stain resistance coatings and pesticides from cotton production. Some of the chemicals may persist in the environment, build up in the body, and affect immune and reproductive systems.The policy brief also discusses measures to reduce chemicals of concern through:legislation and information system tools such regulations, standards and certification mechanisms, and ensuring brands control suppliers to enable compliance;holistic tools that consider the entire value chain such as life cycle assessment tools and eco-innovation;production tools that seek to minimize exposure and focus on cleaner and responsible production and chemical leasing; andconsumption tools that focus on consumer behavior, including sustainable public procurement and ecolabels.The GEF-funded project aims to accelerate the adoption of national and value chain initiatives by promoting: regulatory and voluntary government and industry action to phase out lead in paint; lifecycle management of chemicals present in products; and knowledge management and stakeholder engagement. Being implemented in over 40 countries, the project also seeks to contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

"18 June 2019: For a region that is home to 55% of the world’s population, but accounts for only 18% of global forests, coordinated approaches are urgently needed to reverse biodiversity loss and manage the “special interest trade-offs [that] will, in many cases, be inevitable.” This is one of the key messages contained in the report titled, ‘Forest Futures: Sustainable Pathways for Forests, Landscapes and People in the Asia-Pacific Region,’ published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).The publication is structured around three main sections: an overview of Asia-Pacific forests in a larger landscape context; an examination of the key drivers of change with impacts on forests and forestry; and an exploration of three scenarios, “business-as-usual, aspirational and disruptive,” for 2030 and 2050 to support decision making and action by policymakers and other stakeholders.Young people can shape a sustainable future by changing rigid institutions from within by shaking them up.The report notes that while there has been an overall increase in the area of forests set aside for biodiversity conservation since 2000, “development first” still dominates policy narratives in the Asia-Pacific region, limiting the scope to prevent further biodiversity losses. The report identifies continued population rise, coupled with economic growth and purchasing power, as one of the most significant drivers of change in the sector. It further notes that the resulting changes in land use, as well as other “stressors” such as climate change and infrastructure development conflict, are contributing to declining ecosystem resilience in natural forests, along with the deteriorating capacity of these forests to deliver essential ecosystem services such as water and soil protection, climate regulation, cultural values, and wood, food and medicines.To avoid the “environmental catastrophe” that is likely to result, the report stresses that all actors will need to commit to transformational change that includes “working cross-sectorally and across borders, investing massively to restore forests and landscapes, reforming forest tenure and outdated institutions, empowering communities, and embracing innovation.”The report makes particular note of the role of young people in realizing a more aspirational outcome for the region. Referencing the contributions of around 300 forestry students and young professionals from more than 30 countries that were consulted for the study, the report highlights young people’s confidence that they can shape a sustainable future by taking leadership roles, generating momentum through collaboration and social media and “changing rigid institutions from within by shaking them up.”FAO completed the first Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study (APFSOS I) in 1998 and APFSOS II in 2010. The APFSOS III report was launched during the Asia-Pacific Forestry Week 2019, which took place from 17-21 June 2019 in Incheon, Republic of Korea.

"The UN Statistics Division has launched a report of gender equality trends and statistics. The report is presented as an interactive portal and features 100 “data stories” from around the world.The report titled, ‘The World’s Women 2020: Trends and Statistics,’ was launched on 20 October 2020 – World Statistics Day, which is marked once every five years. The report seeks to answer the question, “What do data tell us about progress towards the commitments made in the Beijing Platform for Action” 25 years after its adoption?The report uses statistics to analyze the state of gender equality around the world in six areas. On economic empowerment, the report finds that unpaid domestic and care work has intensified for both men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic, but women globally still spend about three times as many hours on unpaid domestic and care work as men (4.2 hours compared to 1.7).This restricts women’s participation in the labor market; in 2020, only 47% of women of working age participated in the labor market, compared to 74% of men, and the authors report that this gender gap that has remained relatively constant since 1995. The pandemic is “expected to exacerbate these gender disparities, as many women work in the subsectors hardest hit by COVID-19 and lockdown measures, including in paid domestic work, accommodation and food services, and the retail trade,” the report suggests.On power and decision making, the data show that women held only 28% of managerial positions globally in 2019, which is almost the same proportion as in 1995. In addition, only 18% of enterprises surveyed had a female Chief Executive Officer in 2020, and that percentage drops to 7.4% for Fortune 500 corporations.On education, the report finds that girls and boys are participating equally in primary education in most regions of the world. In tertiary education, women outnumber men, and enrollment is increasing faster for women than for men.On violence against women and girls, an estimated 137 women are killed by their intimate partner or a family member every day. In the past 12 months, 18% of women worldwide have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner.The other two areas for analysis in the report are population and families, and health. The authors also consider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.The report is presented on an online portal, including an interactive map to find stories by region, and datasets organized by the six thematic areas. [Publication:The World’s Women 2020: Trends and Statistics] [DESA News]",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Held on the sidelines of the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), a virtual event highlighted the role of mountain communities in advancing the UN Decade of Action 2020-2030 and achieving the SDGs, particularly in light of COVID-19 impacts.The event, ‘Mountains and the Decade of Action and Delivery,’ emphasized the need to establish long-term processes and policies that strengthen the resilience of mountain peoples and environments. It was organized by theMountain Partnership, and the Governments of Malawi, Argentina, Kyrgyzstan, Italy and Switzerland.During the event, panelists and participants highlighted,inter alia:the amplification of challenges posed by the pandemic in mountain regions, calling for supportive policies, investments, and actions to build resilience and achieve zero hunger;a forthcoming draft resolution, to be tabled by Kyrgyzstan during the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), that aims to promote cross-border cooperation, building on existing mountain sustainable development principles;the need for technical assistance in the Andean region to continue to promote nature-based solutions with multi-stakeholder participation;support for 2022 as the International Year of Mountains;the nexus of land tenure and access to resources;sustainable food systems as a prerequisite for sustainable mountain development;the role of new technologies to “build back better”; andthe importance of addressing the needs of disabled and vulnerable populations within mountain regions.Gobinda Bahadur Shahi, Director, Karnali Integrated Rural Development and Research Centre, linked the impacts of COVID-19 on food security and urged countries to develop their own food security strategies. He urged local governments to incentivize the expansion of self-sufficiency measures, such as home gardens and roof farming.Yuka Makino, Coordinator, Mountain Partnership Secretariat, said the COVID-19 crisis has revealed the value of partnerships.

"7 October 2019: An amended Gothenburg Protocol has entered into force, making it the first binding agreement to target emission reductions for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP).The Protocol sets binding emission reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond for major air pollutants, and was negotiated under the UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) Convention  on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). The Protocol was updated in 2012 to include the reduction of PM2.5, thus addressing air pollution and climate change policies in an integrated manner. The amendments to the Protocol entered into force on 7 October 2019.Reducing PM2.5 levels, specifically black carbon, helps combat climate change. Black carbon traps 680 times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2). It has darkened snow and ice in the Arctic region, and contributed to regional warming.The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol is the first agreement to target multiple air pollutants and their sources.The Protocol also sets emission reduction limits for sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3) and ground-level ozone (O3) precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds, which can have long-term health effects even with mild exposure, are released from,inter alia, motor fuel combustion, heat and power generation, and cooking and heating fuels.Implementing the amended Protocol’s emission reduction measures are estimated to cost less than 0.01% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the EU, making it a cost-effective policy solution, given that healthcare and lost workday costs due to air pollution are estimated at between 2.5% and 7% of GDP per year in Western Europe and above 20% of GDP per year for countries in the pan-European region.Closely linked to climate change, air pollution, which kills seven million people every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is the world’s largest single environmental health risk. It is a leading cause of death by cancer and a major cause of environmental degradation, threatening almost two-thirds of Europe’s ecosystems, and presents a critical barrier for sustainable development.The 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone was the first agreement to target multiple air pollutants and their sources, including combustion plants, electricity production, agriculture, cars and lorries. Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the US and the EU have ratified the Protocol. Additional UNECE member States are expected to ratify the Protocol in the coming months.The 1979 LRTAP Convention has 51 Parties, covering North America and almost the entire European continent, and eight protocols, which have helped to decouple emissions and economic growth, reduce certain air pollutants by 40 to 80%, recover forest soils from acidification, and avoid approximately 600,000 premature deaths per year.

"National security, military and intelligence experts are warning of high to catastrophic threats to security at different warming scenarios, and urging a rapid reduction and phasing out of global emissions.The report titled, ‘A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change,’ constructs its global analysis “through the lens of the U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands.”  It provides regional and international threat assessments for climate change, as well as recommendations going forward.The report, which was published in February 2020, assesses the security implications of two future warming scenarios: near term, 1-2°C; and medium-long term, 2-4°C. It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds,inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; andin the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure. The Indo-Pacific region will experience water scarcity in some areas and precipitation inundation in others, threatening security infrastructure, social stability, and tensions between regional powers.The report was produced by the National Security, Military and Intelligence Panel of the Center for Climate and Security. [Publication:A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change] [Report Landing Page]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
"Five countries are already planning to present voluntary reviews of SDG implementation at the national level during the 2021 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).Voluntary national reviews (VNRs) are a component of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. They are carried out voluntarily by national governments, and are intended to track progress in implementing the Agenda and its SDGs at the country level. VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).China, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Marshall Islands and Slovakia have signed up to conduct and present VNRs in 2021. It will be the Marshall Islands’ first time presenting a VNR, while the other countries have each presented a VNR previously.China and Germany were among the first countries to present a VNR, during the 2016 HLPF. China laterannounceda national action plan and targets for each of the 17 SDGs. Germany’s reporthighlighted: taking all aspects of the SDGs into account and accounting for impact of actions beyond national borders; and strategies to reduce Germany’s ecological footprint, including national strategies for biodiversity and sustainable consumption.Czech Republic reported in 2017,sayingits VNR process had involved stakeholders to ensure factual accuracy and wider acceptance. In 2018, Slovakiahighlightedthe need to: anchor the SDGs in all public policies; engage in partnerships at all levels, from the regional to the municipal; align budgets with 2030 Agenda priorities; and encourage voluntary actions.The 2021 VNRs will be the first to take place following the UN General Assembly’sreviewof the format and organization of the HLPF, which will address the VNRs alongside other elements.

"19 September 2019: The Coalition for Urban Transitions has published a report that show that transitioning to zero-carbon, climate-resilient cities can help achieve national economic prosperity and improve quality of life, while tackling climate change at the same time.The report titled, ‘Climate Emergency: Urban Opportunity: How National Governments Can Secure Economic Prosperity and Avert Climate Catastrophe by Transforming Cities,’ underscores the social and economic benefits of creating net-zero-emission cities, and presents a six-point action plan for national governments. The report concludes that national governments can achieve faster, fairer economic development by investing in zero-carbon cities and that investments in low-carbon measures in cities will be worth at least USD 23.9 trillion by 2050.The six priorities for national action detailed in the report are:developing a strategy to deliver shared prosperity while achieving net zero emissions, focused on compact, connected, clean cities and a partnership between national and local governments;aligning national policies behind cities through,inter alia, removing land-use and building regulations that limit higher density, reforming energy markets to decarbonize the electricity grid, reaching net zero operating emissions in buildings with minimal use of carbon offsets, banning the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles and adopting green alternatives to steel and cement;funding and financing sustainable urban infrastructure through, for example, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, establishing a carbon price of USD 40-80 per tonne, scaling land-based financing instruments to fund sustainable urban infrastructure and limit sprawl, and funding for public transport;coordinating and supporting local climate action in cities through,inter alia, authorizing local governments to introduce climate policies that are more ambitious than national policies, and allocating at least a third of national research and development budgets to support cities’ climate priorities;building a multilateral system that fosters inclusive, zero-carbon cities through, among other measures, scaling up climate action in cities in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), requiring international financial institutions to halt fossil fuel financing and ensuring that international development assistance is aligned with national urban strategies that are compatible with the Paris Agreement on climate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; andproactively planning for a just urban transition through strengthening tenure security for the urban poor, enhancing climate resilience and gender equality through educating youth, using revenues from fossil fuel subsidy reform or carbon taxes to compensate people who bear the costs of climate action, and supporting the future workforce, including by helping with the transition of fossil fuel-based workers and industries.The report, which was released on 19 September 2019, represents a collaborative effort of more than 50 organizations.

"The UN Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) BioTrade Initiative launched revised BioTrade principles and criteria, which apply to terrestrial, avian, and marine and aquatic biodiversity. The updated principles and criteria reflect expanded coverage of marine biodiversity and sustainable tourism, as well as “the climate emergency.”The BioTrade Initiative aims to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through promoting trade and investment in BioTrade products and services. Companies, governments, and other stakeholders apply the principles to conduct the sourcing, production, and commercialization of goods and services derived from native biodiversity (ecosystems, species, and genetic resources) according to environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The BioTrade principles and criteria are based on the value-chain approach, adaptive management approach, ecosystem approach, and sustainable livelihoods. Further, the principles and criteria align with the objectives and principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the SDGs.The ‘2020 BioTrade Principles and Criteria for Terrestrial, Marine and Other Aquatic Biodiversity-based Products and Services’ include seven principles:Conservation of biodiversity;Sustainable use of biodiversity;Fair and equitable sharing of benefits;Socioeconomic sustainability;Legal compliance;Respect for actors’ rights; andRight to use and access natural resources.The publication shows revisions to the principles and criteria. On conservation and biodiversity, for example, the revisions emphasize that the principles do not focus solely on protecting biodiversity but also on restoring and enhancing it. The principle now includes language on “restored, or promoted” genetic diversity. On compliance with national and international legislation, the document states that practices build upon compliance with applicable rules under local, national, and international legislation, and the principle now references “local, national” levels in addition to regional levels. On respect for the rights of actors involved in BioTrade activities, the relevant principle now references “fundamental human rights,” and states that the organization subscribing to the principles “respects the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities.”The BioTrade Initiative launched the original principles in 2007, and began the revision process for the 2020 principles and criteria in May 2018 through a series of meetings and webinars to discuss experiences and lessons learned. The initiative launched a public consultation in 2019 to review inputs and incorporate them into the final revised version. In addition, a session onBlue BioTrade at the 2017 UN Ocean Conferencediscussed ways to adapt BioTrade principles to the ocean and marine sector.The publication includes English, French and Spanish versions. [Publication:2020 BioTrade Principles and Criteria for Terrestrial, Marine and Other Aquatic Biodiversity-based Products and Services] [Publication Landing Page] [UNCTAD Press Release on Launch] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Project on Blue BioTrade in East Caribbean]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1
"The UN has released a report on implementing its Disability Inclusion Strategy, providing a “first baseline on the status of disability inclusion” across the UN system. The Strategy was launched in June 2019 in the context of the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.The Strategy aims to enable the UN system to support the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the SDGs, the Agenda for Humanity prepared for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Strategy will be implemented for five years and then reviewed and updated as needed.The Strategy features four core areas: leadership, strategic planning, and management – including senior leadership that champions disability inclusion, and establishing teams with expertise on disability inclusion; inclusiveness – which entails ensuring full accessibility for all, and actively involving persons with disabilities in all of its work; programming, such as joint initiatives to accelerate progress, and supporting disability-inclusive programming through practical guidance for the field and headquarters; and organizational culture. This means evolving internal systems to attract, recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities in the UN workforce, and building staff capacities to understand disability inclusion. The Strategy is accompanied by 15 performance indicators to facilitate progressive improvement.The first report on implementation of the Strategy establishes a baseline on the status of disability inclusion in the UN system. It also provides recommendations for the system, including ways to support Member States in implementing the CRPD and achieving the SDGs. The report identifies challenges in achieving disability inclusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and disability-inclusive response and recovery efforts.Highlighting the report on 13 October 2020, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammedsaidthe Strategy aims to advance “transformative and lasting change for persons who are too often left behind.” It seeks to spark action to raise the standards of the UN’s performance on disability inclusion, to make an impact with its policies, programmes, and operations, and to “meaningfully engage persons with disabilities, and not just see them as a vulnerable population, but also as actors of change.”Mohammed reported that the UN Secretariat requested all parts of the UN system to demonstrate what they are doing to meet the objectives set in the Strategy’s accountability framework. She said action has been taken across the UN’s three pillars – human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security – both at Headquarters and in the field.The UNGA’s Third Committee (social, humanitarian, and cultural issues) is considering a draft resolution on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/C.3/75/L.9). [Publication:Report of the Secretary-General: Disability Inclusion in the United Nations System] [Landing page for first report] [Publication:United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy] [Disability Inclusion Strategy website]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The World Trade Organization (WTO) has released a report to help least developed countries (LDCs) understand the implications of graduation from LDC status on trade, including implications for countries’ WTO commitments and access to export markets. The report responds to a request from the WTO’s LDC Group to analyze how graduation will impact countries’ trade relations.LDCs enjoy exclusive preferences in the implementation of WTO rules and disciplines and in market access. Once they graduate, LDCs lose this special treatment. There are currently 47 LDCs, 12 of which are at different stages of the graduation process. Angola, Bangladesh, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, Nepal, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are WTO members while Bhutan, Sao Tome and Principe, and Timor-Leste are in the process of negotiating their WTO accession. Kiribati and Tuvalu are on the graduation path but are not WTO members.The report titled, ‘Trade Impacts of LDC Graduation,’ emphasizes the significant contribution of trade to enabling graduating LDCs to reach graduation thresholds. The report finds that graduating LDCs have “diverse economic profiles” with differences in their export structure and their utilization of and reliance on preferential market access. Further, LDCs also have varied terms of entry into the WTO; therefore, graduation will affect graduating LDCs in different ways, and support should therefore be “tailored to the needs and development strategy of each country.”The report concludes that the impact of graduation “appears limited” for most graduating LDCs, with only “marginal increases in tariffs” due to the loss of preferences. The report finds that the biggest impact is likely to be limited to a few export items, such as clothing, fish products, and footwear, that go to a few developed country markets (Canada, the EU, and Japan).The report considers possible actions graduating governments may need to take to adhere to their new non-LDC obligations, including identifying potential support measures that graduating LDCs can build on by working with their development partners to ensure sustainable graduation. The report also suggests graduating governments consider forging appropriate trading arrangements with trading partners and become familiar with options to seek recourse to WTO procedures and instruments if they face difficulties in meeting commitments.The WTO developed the report with theEnhanced Integrated Framework(EIF) as part of a joint project, ‘Trade Impacts of LDC Graduation.’ The WTO and EIF completed the report before the COVID-19 pandemic and recent trade forecasts that predict a “sharp downturn in global trade this year.” Although the report does not consider the impact of COVID-19 on LDCs, the WTO emphasizes in a press release that it remains important for understanding the trade impacts resulting from graduation. The WTO Secretariat plans to undertake a COVID-19 impact analysis for graduating LDCs under the joint project.

"24 September 2019: A report titled, ‘Fixing the Business of Food – The Food Industry and the SDG Challenge,’ spotlights how the food industry is undermining the SDGs, draws attention to the industry’s own development challenges, and makes recommendations for change. The report aims to arm industry leaders with recommendations for supporting healthy and sustainable diets along with sustainable food production methods and supply chains.The Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment (CCSI), the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the Santa Chiara Lab of the University of Siena prepared the report, which launched on 24 September 2019, at the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).The publication explains that current land-use and food systems contribute to “widespread” hunger, malnutrition and obesity. In addition, food systems account for approximately one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, over 90% of scarcity-weighted water use, most losses of biodiversity, over-exploitation of fisheries, nutrient overload in the water, and air and water pollution. At the same time, the report notes, food systems are highly vulnerable to climate change and land degradation. After providing an analysis of how the food industry currently operates, the publication provides recommendations on how to adapt the industry to current planetary challenges such as climate change, urbanization, ocean pollution and population growth.The report provides good practices and recommendations in four areas: promoting and developing healthy and sustainable diets; identifying sustainable ways to produce food; developing sustainable food supply chains; and being a good corporate citizen. It then makes the case for a change in business practices and more harmonized and comparable monitoring and reporting standards, explaining that comparability will support the efforts by companies to set more ambitious targets in the four areas.The publication marks the first phase of a two-year project to identify effective sustainability pathways towards the achievement of the SDGs by the industry. The second phase will consist of engaging with industry leaders to promote the systematization and upgrade of their practices, reporting, monitoring, and public education efforts in alignment with the SDGs. By the text, additional recommendations are expected to be made at the 2020 UNGA. [CCSI Press Release] [Publication:Fixing the Business of Food]",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"13 September 2019: UN Member States have raised no further objections to the draft political declaration on universal health coverage (UHC), thus setting the stage for its adoption at an upcoming high-level meeting on UHC. The text reaffirms countries’ commitment to achieving SDG target 3.8 on achieving UHC, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services, and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.The UN General Assembly (UNGA) will hold the high-level meeting on UHC in New York, US, on 23 September 2019, one of several interconnected,high-level gatheringsduring that week. In a letter to Member States on 13 September, UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés advised that the three-day silence procedure – a final step toward consensus on the draft text – was unbroken.The negotiation process toward the high-level meeting on UHC was co-facilitated by Kaha Imnadze, Permanent Representative of Georgia, and Vitavas Srivihok, Permanent Representative of Thailand. Negotiations previously struckpoints of contentionon: ensuring access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, and reproductive rights; mainstreaming a gender perspective into health policies; leaving no one behind; and the needs of refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons and indigenous peoples.The current draft, conveyed in Espinosa’s10 September letterannouncing the start of the silence procedure, removes a reference to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and maintains SDG language committing to ensure, by 2030, universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services. The text reaffirms the primary role and responsibility of governments to determine their own path towards achieving UHC.

The SDG Impact Standards for Private Equity Funds will be supplemented with a voluntary assurance framework that will include an ‘SDG Impact Seal’ in recognition of best practice.The Standards aim to meet the need for clear guidance and fill a knowledge gap for businesses seeking ways to make a positive impact. The Standards provide a common language to help private equity, venture capital, and other funds in private markets achieve social and/or environmental impact through their investments. The Standards were developed by the UNDP initiative ‘SDG Impact,’ along with industry experts. SDG Impact seeks to empower investors and businesses to support and authenticate their contributions towards achieving the SDGs.In launching the Standards, Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, SDG Impact, said they will help focus approximately USD 4 trillion toward sustainable investments and solutions that can address challenges related to health, poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner highlighted the private sector’s role as a ‘first responder’ to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the provision of technology, innovation, skills, services, and employment, saying the private sector can now also play a critical role in building back better.The Standards are:focused on impact management and decision making, and emphasize transparency and governance;flexible so they can be used by funds of any size, at any stage of development, and at any location;grounded in existing principles, and provide context for applying other tools and frameworks, including metrics, taxonomies and reporting frameworks; andvoluntary and freely available.SDG Impact is also developingStandards for BondsandStandards for Enterprises, which are currently in the public consultation phase.  [Publication:SDG Impact Standards: Private Equity Funds] [FAQs] [Glossary] [Consultation Input]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"A group of civil society organizations (CSOs) has published a “shadow report” to accompany Kyrgyzstan’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) presented to the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The report evaluates the country’s progress towards each of the SDGs, and offers recommendations on how to improve implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Kyrgyzstan.The report by the Forum of Women’s NGOs of Kyrgyzstan titled, ‘Review of the Implementation of the SDG in the Kyrgyz Republic,’ commends Kyrgyzstan’s VNR for including problems and commitments on the next steps for each SDG. It notes that CSOs “made a significant contribution to the fairly high level of objectivity of the report.” At the same time, the CSO warn that the VNR “didn’t cover all aspects of the commitments taken” by Kyrgyzstan within the framework of the 2030 Agenda.The report notes that Kyrgyzstan is behind on almost all of the SDGs. It identifies integration and coordination, short-term approaches, insufficient capacity of the public sector, and weak accountability from the government among the key problems, and highlights COVID-19 impacts on SDG achievement in the country. It also finds that the VNR leaves means of implementation “without serious attention.”The CSOs rate Kyrgyzstan’s progress on each of the Goals on a scale from one to five according to eight criteria of the Action for Sustainable Development (A4SD) People’s Scorecard 2020: 1) availability of a policy or legal framework; 2) plans and strategies; 3) commitment by government agencies; 4) implementation; 5) capacity building; 6) monitoring, evaluation, and reporting; 7) transparency and accountability; and 8) overall progress. For example, on SDG 5 (gender equality), Kyrgyzstan has a score of four in terms of policy or legal framework availability but only two for implementation, capacity building, and overall progress, among other parameters. The report warns that many Goals are “rated below average in terms of achievement.”The CSO report offers 16 recommendations for the government to achieve better implementation of the 2030 Agenda, including:Develop a plan to address problems related to SDG implementation, with annual operational reporting;Ensure institutionalized participation of CSOs in further planning, implementation, and monitoring of SDG implementation;Introduce multi-stakeholder partnership as a mandatory approach to achieve all Goals;Develop mechanisms for introducing the necessary means of implementation for each Goal; andImprove the quality of indicators for each Goal and introduce specific indicators of success.The report was produced with support from A4SD, the Sigrid Rausing Trust, and the Global Fund for Women.

"17 October 2019: Representatives of national, regional and local governments, diplomats, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and public and private sector CEOs have signed a declaration to enhance Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) to help achieve the Paris Agreement on climate change.Paris Agreement Article 12 underscores the importance of ACE and its six elements, namely education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and international cooperation for enhancing actions under the Agreement. According to a UNFCCC press release, countries have been slow to carry out their ACE, with most still lacking an ACE focal point or strategy.The Burgenland Declaration on ACE was signed during an International Symposium and High-level event on ACE, convened by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, in cooperation with the UNFCCC Secretariat from 13-14 October, in Pamhagen in the Austrian state of Burgenland. Signatories to the Burgenland Declaration agreed on the importance of the six elements of ACE  for implementation of the Paris Agreement, and declared their commitment to make ACE fundamental in the planning and actions of governments, organizations, agencies, companies or personal or public enterprises, and to support and encourage others to do the same.The Burgenland Declaration is the kick-off of a global initiative for catalyzing wider engagement in the ACE agenda.The symposium aimed to catalyze wider engagement in and support for ACE implementation, and highlighted the need to mobilize funding at the local, national and international levels to support the ACE agenda.While highlighting recent efforts by youth, Talieh Wögerbauer, Austrian Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism and ACE Ambassador, said young people cannot bear the brunt of responsibility, and emphasized the “fundamental importance of multilateralism,” the private sector as a climate ally and the responsibility of adults. She said the Burgenland Declaration is the “kick-off” of a global initiative for catalyzing wider engagement in and support for implementation of Article 12 and the ACE agenda and its six elements.Martin Frick, UNFCCC, highlighted the importance of empowering people for implementation of the Paris Agreement, educating the public on climate change, and mobilizing funding in support of ACE.The Burgenland Declaration will be presented at a high-level event on ACE during the Santiago Climate Change Conference. Parties are also expected to adopt terms of reference (ToR) for the review of the Doha work programme on UNFCCC Article 6 (cooperative approaches), with the aim of taking stock of ACE implementation and identifying further ACE actions for adoption at the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in 2020.

"Today, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming the world at a fast pace. While it has created an aspiration among many individuals to reap the benefits of technological development, the e-waste management sector often relies on outdated practices, and is in need of innovation.‘Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange’ is a digital platform available for corporates and society to directly transfer their electronic waste to government authorized, technically competent e-waste recyclers. “Smart, convenient, transparent, sustainable and economically valuable,” the platform aims to serve urban citizens and businesses that consume electronic and electrical equipment and to enable development of e-waste-free smart cities. E-Waste Exchange is based on the latest information technologies (IT), and seeks to foster environmental sustainability in the e-waste management sector in India and similar economies.A startup, Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange has been highlighted as a policy recommendation for India and similar economies by the EU’s Resource Efficiency Initiative (EU-REI) Project, implemented by a consortium led by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), Confederation of the Indian Industry (CII) and adelphi.The E-Waste Exchange partners with the Indian state Government of Telangana. Launching the platform on 7 February 2018, Jayesh Ranjan, Indian Administrative Service, Government of Telangana, highlighted the “immense value” of E-Waste Exchange as a “timely and topical” effort to organize waste management business, and its “tremendous social benefit.” In February – March 2018, E-Waste Exchange was successfully presented to the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and to UNIDO India in June 2018. In September 2018, E-Waste Exchange was showcased during the EU’s Circular Economy Mission to India where its contribution to managing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and circular economy was discussed.E-Waste Exchange won the ‘Clean India Grand Challenge,’ and was lauded by the organizers as “a ray of hope to brighten the e-waste management sector.” The initiative’s efforts to contribute to e-waste-free smart cities were also recognized by regular citizens using the platform to dispose of e-waste: “It’s an outstanding idea and very helpful for the citizens who care about environmental protection for future generations.”E-Waste Exchange, with theGlobal Institute for Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Goals, developed ‘RE-CIRCULATE,’ a circular economy model for e-waste management. The model is well suited for implementation by government departments, multi-location offices, corporates, multinationals and conglomerates who are keen to: enhance their green image; contribute to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action); implement circular economy for e-waste and associated plastics; and aim to include the positives of e-waste management into sustainability reporting. E-Waste Exchange is looking forward to partnering with corporates and multinationals to support these goals.Founded by a group of social development and technology experts, in consultation with government departments, industry associations and citizens, Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange aims to find solutions to the e-waste problem, one of the biggest social, economic and environmental challenges of our time, by addressing its root causes.* * *This article was written by Shalini Sharma, Co-Founder and CEO, Sanshodhan: An E-Waste Exchange, T-Hub, Hyderabad, India.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
"July 2019: As the 2019 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) considers how close countries are to achieving the SDGs, a new research paper explores the impact that the research method has on assessments of countries’ relative positions.The article titled, ‘Measuring Sustainable Development Goals Performance: How to Monitor Policy Action in the 2030 Agenda Implementation?’ was authored by Apollonia Miola and Fritz Schiltz. Published inEcological Economics, the paper evaluates the three “most prominent methods” to measure SDG performance at country level. These methods are the Sustainable Development Goals Index, developed by Bertelsmann Stiftung, and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) distance measure, and the progress measures based on Eurostat’s report. The authors find that the selection of method and indicators can influence the country’s relative position.Lead author Apollonia Miola highlights that the debate is open with regard to the most suitable indicators to capture the peculiarities of individual countries, and that the absence of quantitative targets for almost all the official UN indicators is one of the elements that make this question difficult to solve.The authors also conclude that, while they are of the opinion that “ranking countries is not a suited approach to the 2030 Agenda since the search for the best performer is not the purpose of the 2030 Agenda,” SDG performance analysis offers a tool informing how much effort is needed to achieve the SDGs at country level. They indicate that it should be up to “each State to define country specific targets and, then, the choice of the most suited indicators.” [Open Access to the Paper]Full citation:Miola, A. , Schiltz, F.

"21 September 2019: In parallel to theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) announced initiatives to support nature-based solutions to climate change in urban areas. Both endeavors will support the expansion of urban forests as a way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve the health, well-being and resiliency of urban dwellers.Much like the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)Great Green Wall of Africa and the Sahelproject, the FAO initiative will foster a ‘Great Green Wall for Cities.’ It will aim to green urban areas, integrating them into a continuum of restored landscapes. FAO, with partners, will provide support to three cities in each of 30 countries across Africa and Asia to commence the initiative. According to a FAO press release, the goal is to, “by 2030, create 500,000 hectares of new urban forests and restore or maintain 300,000 hectares of existing natural forests in the Sahel and Central Asia.”It is envisioned that the wall will capture 0.5-5 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, and that the introduction of more green infrastructure will help urban areas reduce and prepare for the impacts of climate change. More forests will also diminish heat traps and improve ambient air quality, providing ancillary benefits for people’s overall health and well-being – benefits that will be important given that the proportion of the world’s populations living in cities is projected to reach 70% by 2050. [FAO Press Release]The UNECE also launched a tree-centric campaign to address climate change in urban areas. TheTrees in Cities Challengecalls on mayors to make tree planting pledges towards reducing GHGs and improving their cities’ health and well-being.In launching the campaign, the UNECE highlighted the benefits of trees, namely that they can; reduce pollutants; limit the urban “heat island effect” and reduce air conditioning needs; control erosion, landslides, surface water and floods; boost biodiversity; improve well-being; and elevate property values. A single tree can store up to 150 kg of CO2 per year, an important benefit given that urban areas produce an estimated 75% of CO2 emissions globally.Per theUNECE, the Mayors of Tirana (Albania), Victoria (Canada), Bonn (Germany) and Helsingborg (Sweden) have announced their intentions to join the Challenge, which will factor into their cities’ climate action agendas. The City of Bonn announced that it will plant approximately 25,000 trees in the city forest by the end of 2020. Peter Danielsson, Mayor of Helsingborg welcomed the initiative and pledged to plant 8,000 trees, also by 2020.The Trees in Cities Campaign will run through 2020. Mayors can pledge, track their progress, and share their experiences on theTrees in Cities Challenge platform.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
"A group of 20 well-known activists and advocates released an open letter to world leaders demanding immediate action for the SDGs. An accompanying one-minute video ends by asking, “how will you keep your promise” in 2020?The signatories, “writing as one for the first time,” call on world leaders to move more quickly to end poverty, conquer inequality and fix the climate crisis. Richard Curtis, Project Everyone, says the 20 activists and a broader network of 2,000 supporters – for a total of 2,020 campaigners – represent the “passion from all sides that 2020 must be a transformative, radical year for change and progress and new finance – for people and planet.”We need you to act faster to find the finance and unlock radical solutions.The open letter posted at the Global Goals website recalls countries’ commitment to the SDGs five years ago, contrasting the Goals’ vision to current conditions around the world, including rising temperatures, children living without vital food and health care, and millions fleeing their homes. The advocates “need you to act faster… to find the finance [and] unlock radical solutions. We are watching you.”The signatories include: Nobel Peace Prize laureates Malala Yousafzai and Nadia Murad; Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of Bring Back our Girls; environmental campaigner Jane Goodall; Fridays for Future organizer Alexandria Villasenor; Amnesty International Secretary-General Kumi Naidoo; gender equality campaigners Alaa Murabit, Trisha Shetty, and MeToo founder Tarana Burke; and Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors.The 2000 additional “backers” for the letter include teachers, dentists, athletes, journalists, business executives, politicians, actors, musicians, novelists, UN officials, NGO leaders and former heads of state and government, such as Christiane Amanpour, Bono, Tom Brady, Idris Elba, Julia Gillard, Bear Grylls, Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee, Yo Yo Ma, David Miliband, Paul Polman and Mary Robinson.The Global Goals website featuring the letter and video also provides an interactive tool on ‘Key Moments in 2020,’ noting that each listed event requires “pressure for extra money and major new commitments.” [Global Goals ‘Watch’ campaign] [Business Green story]",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) launched a framework methodology to analyze the vulnerability of forests and forest-dependent people to climate change. FAO launched the methodology at an event on the sidelines of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP25) to the UNFCCC.Forests and trees play a critical role in reducing the vulnerability of communities to climate change, but, FAO stresses, it can be challenging to determine the extent to which a forest and its dependent community are vulnerable to climate impacts. Within this context, the ‘FAO Framework Methodology for Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments of Forests and Forest Dependent People,’ aims to provide a simple approach to conducting such assessments. The methodology brings together common elements among many available methods and provides step-by-step guidance on its implementation.The tool will enable assessments that are “indispensable for ground-level action to adapt to climate change.”FAO Forestry Department Assistant Director-General, Hiroto Mitsugi, said the tool, released on 6 December 2019, will enable assessments that are “indispensable for ground-level action to adapt to climate change.” FAO has called for immediate action to “increase forest resilience and reduce the threat posed to the livelihoods and well-being of forest-dependent households.”Also on forest assessments, the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) held a six-day training event to build the capacity of five African island countries to conduct the FRA 2020 Global Remote Sensing Survey. The survey aims to produce consistent, independent estimates of forest area and changes over time at biome, regional and global levels.

"A side event held during the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, explored the potential of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to decarbonize industry and help the ocean.Convened on 4 December, the event titled, ‘Carbon Removal and Return: Can CCS Decarbonize Industry in South America and Help the Oceans?’ was organized by the University of Texas (US), in collaboration with the CCS Association (CCSA), the International CCS Knowledge Centre (ICKC), Bellona, and the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEAGHG).Moderator Tim Dixon, General Manager, IEAGHG, reported on progress related to CCS, including: approved sets of rules for its application in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and inclusion in climate actions necessary for avoiding more than 1.5°C warming in 2100.Andrew Jupiter, University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago, reported the commitment of his country’s Ministry of Planning and Development to support CCS and benefits that would be accrued for carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation, given the country’s large heavy petrochemical sector.Beth Hardy, ICKC, spoke about the potential of CCS to decarbonize cement, whose manufacture represents 8% of global carbon emissions. She said CCS will be critical to keep warming below 2°C. She drew attention to a recent partnership between ICKC and Lehigh Cement, with an allocation of CAD 1.4 million for a feasibility study of a facility that could capture 600,000 tons of CO2 per year.Panelists and participants also discussed:the IPCCSpecial Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere(SROCC), which identified oceans as the largest carbon sink;bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), noting its potential for achieving multiple SDGs, including those related to climate action (SDG 13), life on land (SDG 15), clean water (SDG 6), and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7);the need for flexible low-carbon infrastructure for CCS in industry, stressing that CO2 removal is not a substitute for mitigation and reducing carbon emissions;increased interest in direct air capture due to fewer incentives for injecting carbon in the ground;CCS as a recognized technology in discussions under the UNFCCC and next steps, including upscaling CCS technologies to meet countries’ NDCs; andwhether BECCS can be applied in sugarcane production and whether injecting CO2 in the ground and offshore can cause acidification of water.[IISD RS Coverage of Side Event] [IEAGHG Website] [University of Texas at Austin’s Gulf Cost Carbon Center Website]* * *IISD Reporting Services is providing coverage ofselected side eventsduring the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid.",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1
"11 October 2019: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the Government of Norway are cooperating to improve global statistics on forest resources. The three-year project is part of the FAO’s wider Forest Resource Assessment (FRA), which collects official forest resource information on all aspects of sustainable forest management (SFM) from 236 countries and territories.Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) is providing US$3 million to FAO to organize capacity development events that will focus on improving reporting on forest resources and making these data more complete, timely and easier to access. The trainings will also build the capacity of developing country participants to use satellite remote sensing to collect data on forest area, biomass and carbon stocks.FAO Forestry Policy and Resources Chief, Tiina Vähänen, said country data “are the backbone of the FRA.” Through this project, she said FAO will provide extensive capacity development and will help developing countries “to collect, analyze and report forest related information in a transparent manner.” FAO further emphasized the importance of global forest information to support policy formulation and decision-making to protect and sustainably manage forests and achieve the SDGs.

The theme aims to raise awareness of the work that IMO and its member States undertake to contribute to achieving the SDGs.IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim proposed the theme, saying he believes it will provide opportunities for the IMO Secretariat and member States to highlight the “already significant contributions of shipping and the IMO” to building a sustainable future. Lim highlighted the contributions of the Organization and the shipping industry towards a sustainable future, including the implementation of the Ballast Water Management Convention, adoption of measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improvements in the efficiency of shipping through the exchange of electronic information, and efforts to reduce marine litter, protect the polar regions and reduce the sulfur content of ships’ fuel oil.Lim said the IMO Secretariat’s SDGs Strategy outlines the Organization’s strategic approach to contribute to SDG achievement. He emphasized the year 2020 will mark the “beginning of a decade of action and delivery” that will be decisive for both the shipping industry and for life on the planet. Lim further highlighted the SDG Summit, the Climate Action Summit and the UN Ocean Conferences as opportunities for the shipping sector to reflect on progress to date and future steps towards a sustainable future.The IMO Council endorsed the theme at its 122nd session.

"23 August 2019: The Government of Canada has conducted a gender-based analysis plus (GBA+) on a potential free trade agreement (FTA) between Canada and the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. This is the first time such an analysis has been carried out on an ongoing free trade negotiation.In March 2018, the Government of Canada committed to conduct an expanded impact assessment on the Mercosur FTA negotiations, including examining potential impacts on gender and labor using a GBA approach. GBA is a tool used to analyze the potential opportunities and impacts of a government policy, programme or other initiative on people, including women, indigenous peoples and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The tool aims to help support Canada’s inclusive approach to trade, which emphasizes that the benefits and opportunities resulting from FTAs should be widely shared among diverse groups of people.The gender-based analysis aims to address trade and economic development in a way that benefits more Canadians, said Jim Carr.The initial summary of the GBA+ includes an economic impact assessment that considers gross domestic product (GDP) gains, trade gains, job and wage gains, income inequality, gendered impacts, labor force participation, youth and SMEs. On income inequality, for example, the analysis finds that real wage gains are likely to be strongest in percentage terms for manual laborers and machinery operators, whose wages would grow at a faster pace than those of workers in managerial, professional and technical groups, which would therefore help mitigate income inequality in Canada and support wider benefits from trade.For youth, the proposed FTA is estimated to result in higher employment as a result of a rise in new job market opportunities. Similarly, the proposed FTA is likely to add more jobs for female workers, contributing to their expanded role in the labor force. The summary concludes that the proposed FTA would generate economic benefits for both economies, including “positive effects for under-represented groups in Canada’s economy,” promoting gender balance in the economy, encouraging youth employment and increasing the number of SMEs in Canada.The GBA summary is expected to inform the ongoing negotiations and help identify opportunities to add new gender-responsive and inclusive trade provisions across the FTA. The initial GBA+ is complementary to Canada’s Feminist Foreign Policy, and helps support progress on the government’s Gender Results Framework, which aims to promote gender equality around the world, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality).Canada’s Minister of International Trade Diversification, Jim Carr, said the gender-based analysis“will help to ensure that Canada’s FTAs, such as the Canada-Mercosur agreement, address trade and economic development in a way that benefits more Canadians,” including SMEs owned by women and indigenous peoples.

The coalition reports that this target, which was announced at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, is necessary to meet global climate goals while enhancing economic prosperity in all countries.The ‘Three Percent Club’ brings together 15 governments (Argentina, Colombia, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Portugal, Senegal and the UK) and 13 businesses and international organizations to help put the world on a path to achieve the necessary annual energy efficiency improvements to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change.Energy efficiency can help reduce emissions while improving people’s well-being.Coalition participants will share and provide technical and financial support, including by leveraging the combined global resources of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the International Energy Agency (IEA), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) Energy Efficiency Accelerators and Hub, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Energy Efficiency Global Alliance.“Energy efficiency is the one energy resource that all countries share in abundance, and it can help reduce emissions while improving people’s well-being,” said Fatih Birol, Executive Director, IEA.A Climate Action Summit press release notes that energy efficiency has the potential of delivering 40% of the emission reductions required to meet global climate goals. However, only a few countries make specific commitments to improve energy efficiency in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and, according to the IEA, the rate of improvement is currently slowing down (1.3% in 2018).The Three Percent Club was launched under the Climate Action Summit’s Energy Transition Track. Its commitment to improving energy efficiency through ambitious policy measures aligns with the mission of theGlobal Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency, established by the IEA in July 2019.

"24 September 2019: The Champions 12.3, a coalition dedicated to inspiring ambition, action, and accelerating progress towards achieving SDG target 12.3 to halve food waste and reduce food loss worldwide by 2030, held its annual summit and released its annual progress report on the sidelines of theUN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit.Prepared by the World Resources Institute (WRI), the 2019 progress report represents the fourth in an annual series of publications assessing progress towards SDG target 12.3. The report finds that governments representing 50% of the world’s population have set an explicit national target in line with SDG target 12.3. However, governments representing just 12% of the population are measuring food loss and waste, and countries representing just 15% of the world’s population are pursuing reduction actions at scale.Further the report highlights that of the world’s 50 largest food companies, more than two-thirds have set goals in line with SDG target 12.3, more than 40% are measuring their food loss and waste, and one-third are pursuing actions at scale to reduce waste in their own operations.The report urges governments to set ambitious targets and “act boldly” to reduce food loss and waste, especially because such commitments could also spur progress towards the Paris Agreement on climate change as well as other agreed development goals and priorities.The Champions 12.3 summit also featured announcements towards achieving SDG target 12.3. Some of the highlights came from a newly launched ‘10x20x30’ initiative, the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) and the World Bank.The 10x20x30 initiative will convene ten of the world’s biggest food retailers and providers to each engage with 20 of their priority suppliers to halve their rates of food loss and waste by 2030. Founding partners are AEON, Ahold Delhaize, IKEA Food, Kroger, METRO AG, Pick n Pay, The Savola Group, Sodexo, Tesco, and Walmart. Five of the ten are the largest food retailers in the world.The SRP – a global multi-stakeholder alliance including some of the world’s leading rice producers and buyers, including Olam, Mars Food, Loc Troi, Ebro Foods, SunRice, LT Foods, and Phoenix Global – set a target, and called upon its members and the wider industry to commit to halving post-harvest rice loss and waste by 2030. Its commitments include developing a taskforce and roadmap of best practices to achieve the 50% reduction.The World Bank reported that it raised USD 1 billion for sustainable development bonds addressing food loss and waste, since March 2019. A separatepress releasediscusses the World Bank’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) launch of Sustainable Development Bonds totaling USD 500 million. The Norinchukin Bank, a national-level financial institution for agricultural, fishery and forestry cooperatives in Japan, was the sole investor. The IBRD uses such funds to support middle-income countries to address food loss and waste, with investments in infrastructure, access to markets and logistics and waste management.

"19 September 2019: In advance of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, Amazon and Global Optimism, former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres’s podcast, launched ‘The Climate Pledge,’ a commitment to meet the Paris Agreement ten years early. The Climate Pledge calls on signatories to make their businesses net zero carbon by 2040.Companies signing on to the Pledge agree to:Measure and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a regular basis;Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions and other carbon emission elimination strategies; andNeutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.Bold steps by big companies will make a huge difference in the development of new technologies and industries to support a low-carbon economy.“Large companies signing The Climate Pledge will send an important signal to the market that it’s time to invest in the products and services the signatories will need to meet their commitments,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. For example, Amazon’s USD 440 million investment in Rivian, a producer of emissions-free electric vehicles, will accelerate the production of electric vehicles to reduce emissions from transportation.“Bold steps by big companies will make a huge difference in the development of new technologies and industries to support a low-carbon economy,” Figueres commented.Amazon also launched asustainability websiteto report on its commitments, initiatives and performance, including information on its carbon footprint and other sustainability metrics that share the progress the company is making towards reaching The Climate Pledge.

"The Alliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA) issued a policy brief explaining why countries should adopt a source-to-sea approach to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The brief is based on a 2019 study by AGWA and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) that analyzes the extent to which countries have integrated such approaches in their national climate plans.According to the brief, titled ‘Source-to-Sea is Key to Climate Security,’ source to sea approaches embrace system-wide thinking and acknowledge the interdependencies of flows and services throughout river basins, deltas, coasts and marine areas. Considering these linkages, the brief highlights that, it is “possible to achieve much-needed coordination across institutions, sectors and public uses.”AGWA and SIWI further highlight the possibilities for source-to-sea approaches to address the challenge of fragmented governance of water, and to improve the effectiveness of national climate plans. The publication presents four main  recommendations for implementing them in the context of national adaptation and mitigation actions:integrating source-to-sea assessments into climate-related planning processes;building capacity to coordinate land, coastal and freshwater management in climate plans;coordinating approaches to build ecosystem resilience; andmonitoring and sharing outcomes and lessons.The report is one of four AGWA policy reportsreleasedon the occasion of the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP 25) in Madrid, Spain. AGWA is a multi-stakeholder network for sustainable water resource management.

"The intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will enter the consultation and negotiation process in mid-January 2021, according to the co-facilitators.Alexander Marschik, Permanent Representative of Austria, and Cheikh Niang, Permanent Representative of Senegal, are leading the review of the HLPF and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) after beingappointedby the President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in November 2020. In a letter to UN Member States on 15 December 2020, the co-facilitators say they will begin informal consultations with Member States in mid-January 2021 and aim to finalize negotiations by the end of March 2021. This timeline is designed to avoid competing with other processes taking place in the second quarter of 2021, the co-facilitators note.The intergovernmental review was originally mandated for the 74th UNGA session (September 2019-September 2020), in order to reflect on the HLPF’s first four-year “cycle” and consider ways to strengthen ECOSOC – under whose auspices the HLPF convenes each year. Consultations began in February 2020 with governmentsexchanging viewson the HLPF review’s scope, critical issues to be addressed, ways to improve HLPF mechanisms such as the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process and thematic follow-up and review, and how best to include stakeholders.In April 2020, consultations werepostponeduntil “after the most acute aspects of the COVID-19 crisis have been addressed and the United Nations has resumed its normal operations.” Governments agreed to resume the review during the UNGA’s 75th session (September 2020-September 2021).The HLPF was established in 2013 through UNGA resolution67/290. In 2016 the Assembly adopted resolution70/299, by which it decided to review progress on implementation during the 74th session “to benefit from lessons learned in the first cycle” of the HLPF.The first cycle refers to the four annual HLPF sessions held under ECOSOC’s auspices in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, during which the Forum held reviews of progress on selected SDGs, eventually reviewing all 17 Goals. [Co-facilitators’ letter to Member States]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"UN Member States in the Asia-Pacific and Arab regions affirmed commitments to accelerate and intensify actions toward gender equality, at their respective regional meetings leading to the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW-64).The Arab regional review quantified and highlighted the economic value of gender equality, noting that women’s participation in the economy could increase the region’s GDP by USD1.5 trillion by 2025. The Asia-Pacific review meeting pledged to strengthen national capacities to collect and use disaggregated data to provide a clear picture of the gender gap.In addition to informing CSW 64 in March 2020, the regional reviews also comprise the preparations for the 25-year review of the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Programme of Action. This anniversary (Beijing+25) will be marked with a high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly in September 2020.TheAsia-Pacific meetingtook place from 27-29 November 2019, in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by UN Women and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP). It resulted in a 13-page document outlining a wide range of actions toward gender equality, including commitments to integrate a gender-responsive approach into national follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda and Beijing+25.TheAsia-Pacific Declaration on Advancing Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: Beijing+25 Reviewexpresses concern about the negative impacts of rising inequalities, rapid demographic change and climate change, which, it is noted, hampers efforts toward gender equality. The Declaration covers many actions in the areas of,inter alia: equitable and inclusive development, shared prosperity and decent work; poverty eradication; environmental conservation, climate action and resilience-building; and peaceful and inclusive societies.The Arab review found that women’s participation in the economy could increase the region’s GDP by USD1.5 trillion by 2025.Themeetingof UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Member States convened in Amman, Jordan, on 28 November 2019, organized by UN Women and ESCWA. Haifa Abu Ghazaleh, League of Arab States (LAS), lamented that Arab women’s economic participation remains the lowest globally, stressing that this is “no longer acceptable.”TheArab Declaration on Progress in the Implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action after 25 yearshighlights the challenges of poverty, unemployment, widening class inequalities and the impacts of terrorism in the region. Member States call for,inter alia: continued review of national legislation to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women; greater commitment to UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security; and adoption of a new Security Council resolution to address the situation of women in the State of Palestine.Regional review meetings for Africa and Europe took place in October 2019.

"The Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action issued a statement reaffirming commitment to mainstream climate into fiscal, economic, and financial policies amid challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action convened virtually on 12 October, under the chairmanship of Chile’s Minister of Finance Ignacio Briones and Finland’s Minister of Finance Matti Vanhanen. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 2020 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group.In thejoint ministerial statement, the Coalition reaffirms its commitment to the 2019Helsinki Principles, and notes efforts to address the needs of citizens and economies during the COVID-19 crisis and to ensure an inclusive, low-emission, resilient, and sustainable economic recovery while aligning policies to climate action. The ministers look forward to engaging in dialogue with partners and stakeholders to better understand the technical and political challenges to implementing the Helsinki Principles, and “stand ready” to contribute to “a successful COP 26 in 2021.”Countries now have a chance to set themselves on a greener, smarter, and more equitable development path.The ministers also strengthened the Coalition’s governance arrangements through aCharterto support members’ efforts to mainstream climate change in economic policies. They approved the Coalition’s firstannual report, and welcomed three recent reports produced for the Coalition:‘Ministries of Finance and Nationally Determined Contributions: Stepping Up for ClimateAction’;‘Long-Term Strategies for Climate Change: A Review of Country Cases’; and‘Better Recovery, Better World: Resetting Climate Action in the Aftermath of the COVID-19Pandemic.’Addressing the ministers, Vanhanen signaled the Coalition’s readiness to support members in addressing climate change through economic policy measures. He said COVID-19 recovery efforts must be aligned with climate policy targets.“Countries now have a chance to set themselves on a greener, smarter, and more equitable development path,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. He highlighted opportunities to deliver the benefits of cleaner air and water, healthier oceans, more resilient cities, and more sustainable food and agriculture systems, as well as new jobs that are sustainable, inclusive, and equitable.Highlighting climate change as “a profound threat to growth and prosperity,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva called for a carbon price floor covering the majority of global emissions.Coalition members and institutional partners delivered pre-recorded video statements on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted fiscal policies related to climate change.Launched in April 2019, the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action brings together 52 developed and developing countries from all regions, jointly accounting for about 16% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and 30% of global gross domestic product (GDP).

"The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has launched a Global Framework for Urban Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), which offers a strategic vision for urban WASH programming across global, regional, and country levels. Through the Framework, UNICEF intends to increase its engagement in urban areas and create a common vision for its approach to urban programming that focuses on marginalized children and their families.The Framework, which was published in February 2020, is based on UNICEF’s experiences in urban WASH programming in over 50 countries, and came about as a result of: expanding urban populations with unequal access to WASH services; the need for universal access to water and sanitation to achieve the SDGs; and the fact that poor WASH services threaten public health, especially in high-density urban areas.Although children in urban areas tend to have better access to WASH than their rural counterparts, inequalities are stark, with the poorest often having little or no ability to use these basic services. This is particularly the case for children living in slums and other impoverished urban settlements. In addition, the impacts of climate change, environmental hazards, and natural disasters are magnified in such settlement, which often face overcrowding, lack of urban planning, and vulnerable WASH infrastructures. These realities exacerbate children’s vulnerabilities and lack of access, and have driven the focus on meeting urban WASH needs.The Framework is meant to be used by regional and country offices to develop more localized, context-specific urban WASH frameworks and strategies for urban slums, small towns, and urban areas in humanitarian and protracted crisis settings. It provides opportunities for partnerships and is structured around support at the sector, service, and user levels, with suggested entry points and activities for engagement.At the ‘sector level,’ support comprises UNICEF interventions at the national (sector) level, aimed at supporting governments and partnering with other organizations to strengthen the enabling environment to deliver effective, sustainable, and inclusive urban WASH interventions. Such interventions include: evidence generation and analysis; institutional support and coordination; sector financing; capacity development; and planning, monitoring, and review.At the ‘service level,’ support encompasses UNICEF’s work to improve the delivery of WASH to the urban population through formal, informal, private, or public service providers, and regulators. Priority entry points for this support include: supporting service delivery mechanisms to reach the poorest populations; supporting demand and supply approaches for urban WASH; and promoting poor-inclusive financing strategies for inclusive urban WASH services.Finally, ‘user-level’ support focuses on: empowering communities and families, and increasing their access to WASH services, and their capacity to engage with service providers and policymakers. Achieving this, the Framework notes, requires encouraging low-income urban communities to participate in planning and implementation of WASH services and strengthening accountability structures. [UN-Water] [Global Framework for Urban WASH Landing Page] [Summary of the Global Framework for Urban WASH] [Global Framework for Urban WASH]",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) released the latest edition of their joint publication on employment in the region, with findings pointing to the importance of addressing gender gaps in the labor market to achieve the SDGs. The authors stress the critical role of women’s access to paid employment in helping the region to reduce poverty, tackle inequality and ensure economic growth.The report titled, ‘Employment Situation in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evolution of and prospects for women’s labour participation in Latin America,’ identifies a “large increase” in women’s participation in paid activities as one of the most important trends in the region’s labor market (although the report cautions that greater participation in the labor market does not necessarily result in greater quality of life or greater quality of employment). The average participation rate for women 15 years and older increased by 11 percentage points in Latin America over the past 30 years, the largest increase globally. Countries with the highest female labor participation rate are Peru, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Paraguay. Countries with the lowest rates are Guatemala (39.2%), Mexico (43.5%) and Costa Rica (45.1%). Despite these overall gains, female labor participation in the region remains “significantly behind developed countries.” The gap between women’s labor participation rate and men’s labor participation was 25.9 percentage points in 2018, on average.Better quality jobs are “losing ground” against sectors with more informal labor conditions.Large differences also exist among countries in terms of the levels of female labor participation and the pace of growth. Women’s participation in the labor market in rural areas increased in some countries – including Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic – but decreased in Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Guatemala and Peru.The publication recognizes Latin America’s progress on a number of factors that positively affect women’s decision to participate in the labor market, including social norms and political rights. Additional factors include equal access to education, improved reproductive services and a decline in the fertility rate, and greater average levels of income. Increased access to technologies also has reduced the amount of time women spend on domestic tasks, and increased flexibility in the place, form and modality of work. However, the report finds that the region still lags behind in some areas that could hinder growth in female labor participation, including cultural attitudes that promote reproductive and caring roles for women, and gender gaps in expected economic returns on education.The report also examines the region’s labor market performance during the first half of 2019. Low economic growth affected job creation, and the average regional urban unemployment rate in the region remained steady at 10.1%. The authors conclude that the job categories and sectors that typically create better quality jobs are “losing ground” against sectors with more informal labor conditions.The report is prepared twice yearly by ECLAC’s Economic Development Division and the ILO’s Office for the Southern Cone of Latin America.

"The Marrakech Partnership published a report that outlines pathways for climate action across eight key sectors to achieve the Paris Agreement on climate change. The report finds that rapid breakthroughs in the areas of energy, industry, transport, human settlements, ocean and coastal zones, water, nature-based solutions and land use, and climate resilience are approaching “the tipping points necessary to reach zero emissions by 2050.”The ‘Climate Action Pathways’ seek to provide a “blueprint” to coordinate climate action by cities, regions, businesses, and investors in the runup to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021. The pathways identify the near- and long-term milestones for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in each of the eight sectors considered. They provide an overview of “synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas that assist all actors to take an integrated approach.”As an example, the transformational actions and milestones needed to achieve zero-carbon economy for ocean and coastal zones include:Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are ended by 2021, and science-based management is implemented to restore fish stocks in the shortest time possible;30% of fully and highly protected marine protected areas are designated and implemented by 2030;Resilience and adaptive capacity of ocean-dependent coastal communities (fisheries and aquaculture) are increased, and vulnerability assessments are conducted by 2025; andStable market of zero-carbon fuels is ensured by 2030.Speaking at the launch, High-Level Climate Champion Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) underscored the need for “a major transition, from where we are today to where we need to be by 2050” to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. “[I]t is vital that we have a clear map of the route ahead,” he said.The Climate Action Pathways, which complement theYearbook of Global Climate Action, were unveiled during theRace to Zero Dialogues, running from 9-19 November 2020. The dialogues aim to explore ways to drive the systems’ transformations needed to mitigate climate change and build resilience to its impacts.Led by the UNFCCC High-Level Climate Champions, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action supports implementation of the Paris Agreement by promoting collaboration between governments and cities, regions, businesses, and investors. It brings together more than 320 initiatives and coalitions, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Oxford University, World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and WWF.
